  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft has issued an emergency KB5064489 update to fix a bug that prevented Azure VMs from launching when Trusted Launch was disabled and VBS was enabled.

Microsoft recommends using the out-of-band update and enabling Trusted Launch. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-kb5064489-emergency-update-fixes-azure-vm-launch-issues/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
