  <ul>
    <li><strong>WatchGuard Fireware OS Zero-Day (CVE-2025-14733)</strong>: WatchGuard issued an urgent patch for a critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Daemon (iked) process, allowing unauthenticated RCE on Firebox devices. CISA added this to the KEV Catalog on Dec 19, 2025. Shadowserver has identified 125,000 vulnerable exposed IPs. Users should upgrade to 2025.1.4, 12.11.6, or 12.5.15 immediately. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/threat-actors-zero-day-watchguard-firebox" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MacSync Infostealer evades Gatekeeper</strong>: A new notarized Swift variant of MacSync targets macOS using code-signed disk images to bypass security checks. It exfiltrates keychains, browser data, and crypto wallets. While Apple revoked the associated certificate, the malware uses file inflation and sandbox detection to remain effective. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-macsync-malware-dropper-evades-macos-gatekeeper-checks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Frogblight Android Trojan targets Turkey</strong>: Kaspersky identified this specialized banking Trojan disguised as legal or social aid apps. It harvests SMS permissions and uses WebViews to inject malicious JavaScript into banking portals for credential theft. It features advanced geofencing and sandbox evasion. <a href="https://hackread.com/frogblight-malware-android-fake-court-aid-apps/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Nezha monitoring tool weaponized as RAT</strong>: Threat actors are repurposing the open-source Nezha utility to gain root access across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Due to its "benign" nature and high GitHub popularity, it maintains a 0/72 detection rate on VirusTotal while providing full remote command execution. <a href="https://hackread.com/hackers-abuse-monitoring-tool-nezha-trojan/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Tren de Aragua (TdA) ATM Jackpotting</strong>: The US DOJ indicted 54 individuals linked to the Venezuelan TdA group for a $40M "Ploutus" malware operation. The group used physical access and hard drive replacements to compromise ATMs across the U.S. to fund transnational criminal activities. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/54-charged-in-us-over-atm-attacks-involving-ploutus-malware/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
