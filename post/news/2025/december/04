     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Critical RCE in React Server Components (CVE-2025-55182)</strong>: A maximum-severity vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in the **React Server Components (RSC) protocol** allows unauthenticated **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** due to unsafe deserialization of specially crafted HTTP requests. This flaw also impacts the **Next.js framework** (CVE-2025-66478). Organizations must update immediately to **React versions 19.0.1+** and corresponding Next.js versions, as exploitation is noted as easy and high-fidelity. Cloudflare deployed WAF rules for immediate mitigation. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/critical-react-flaw-triggers-immediate-action" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>WordPress King Addons PE Flaw Actively Exploited (CVE-2025-8489)</strong>: A critical, actively exploited **privilege escalation** flaw (CVSS 9.8) in the **WordPress King Addons for Elementor** plugin allows unauthenticated attackers to immediately create administrator accounts. The vulnerability, present in versions 24.12.92 through 51.1.14, is due to improper role restriction during registration. Admins must urgently update the plugin to **version 51.1.35 or later** to prevent full site control, malicious code upload, and content modification. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/185286/hacking/king-addons-flaw-lets-anyone-become-wordpress-admin.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>CISA KEV Catalog Adds OpenPLC SCADA Flaw</strong>: CISA added **CVE-2021-26828**, an unrestricted file upload flaw in **OpenPLC ScadaBR**, to its KEV Catalog due to confirmed active exploitation. This vulnerability allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code. Recent exploitation is linked to the pro-Russian hacktivist group **TwoNet**, which targeted a water treatment honeypot. Federal agencies must remediate by December 23, 2025. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/12/03/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>CISA KEV Catalog Adds Two Android Zero-Days</strong>: CISA added two actively exploited Android Framework zero-day flaws to its KEV Catalog: **CVE-2025-48572** (high-severity privilege escalation) and **CVE-2025-48633** (information disclosure). Google confirmed both are under limited, targeted exploitation, often associated with **commercial spyware** or nation-state campaigns. Federal agencies must patch these flaws by December 23, 2025. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/12/02/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Microsoft Silently Patches Windows LNK Misinterpretation Flaw (CVE-2025-9491)</strong>: Microsoft silently patched a critical Windows Shortcut (LNK) file UI misinterpretation flaw (CVSS 7.8) as part of November Patch Tuesday. This RCE vulnerability allows malicious commands to be hidden from the user interface due to target field truncation. The flaw has been actively exploited since 2017 by at least 11 state-sponsored groups (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia) for espionage, delivering malware like XDigo and PlugX. CISA has added it to the KEV Catalog. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/microsoft-silently-patches-windows-lnk.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>DragonForce Ransomware Forms Cartel with Scattered Spider</strong>: The **DragonForce RaaS** operation has rebranded as a "ransomware cartel," offering 80% profit shares and customizable tools. The newest variant (derived from Conti v3) enhances its codebase to use **BYOVD attacks** via vulnerable drivers (e.g., *truesight.sys*) to disable security software. It has formed a potent alliance with initial access broker **Scattered Spider**, which specializes in social engineering and MFA bypass, to deploy DragonForce across Windows, Linux, and ESXi environments. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/deep-dive-into-dragonforce-ransomware-and-its-scattered-spider-connection/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Aisuru Botnet Launches Record 29.7 Tbps DDoS Attack</strong>: The **Aisuru botnet-for-hire service**, an evolution of the Mirai-class IoT botnet, launched a new record-breaking **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack peaking at **29.7 Tbps** using a UDP carpet-bombing technique. The botnet comprises an estimated 1-4 million compromised IoT devices (routers, cameras) recruited via N-day exploits, weak credentials, and at least one zero-day in Cambium Networks cnPilot routers. Compromised devices are also being rented as residential proxies. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/aisuru-botnet-behind-new-record-breaking-297-tbps-ddos-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Massive Indonesian Gambling Network Hides C2 Infrastructure</strong>: A 14-year-old operation focused on illegal online gambling and malware in Indonesia is also acting as a hidden **Command and Control (C2) and anonymity infrastructure** for other threat actors. The network spans over **328,000 domains**, including 90,000 hacked sites and 1,400 hijacked government subdomains, which are used to deploy NGINX-based reverse proxies to quietly forward malicious traffic. The sophistication is assessed to have the profile of an **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/12/03/indonesian-online-gambling-network/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Malicious Rust Package Targets Web3 Developers</strong>: A malicious Rust package, **evm-units**, was discovered on the crates.io repository, executing a stealthy supply chain attack against Web3 developers on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Masquerading as an Ethereum Virtual Machine utility, the package reached over 7,000 downloads and was embedded in the **uniswap-utils** crate. The cross-platform loader fetches and runs an OS-specific payload, and notably checks for the **Qihoo 360 antivirus** process, suggesting a focus on targets associated with the Chinese cryptocurrency market. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/malicious-rust-crate-delivers-os.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>ClickFix Social Engineering Explores Fake ChatGPT Atlas Installer</strong>: A recent surge in the **ClickFix social engineering attack** is exploiting a fake installer for the ChatGPT Atlas AI browser to steal user passwords. The technique, which has seen a **517% increase**, tricks users via cloned, legitimate-looking websites into executing an obfuscated command line script. This script repeatedly prompts the user for their password until correct, then uses it to escalate privileges, reportedly enabling it to bypass advanced security tools like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. <a href="https://hackread.com/fake-chatgpt-atlas-clickfix-steal-passwords/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>CISA Warns of Targeted Spyware on Encrypted Platforms</strong>: CISA issued a direct warning about multiple, advanced spyware campaigns actively targeting high-value users (politicians, military, officials) on encrypted platforms like **Signal and WhatsApp**. State-backed and financial actors are using commercial surveillance tools, zero-click exploits, and sophisticated social engineering. The attacks strategically **compromise the device endpoint** (e.g., via Samsung zero-day LANDFALL) to exfiltrate data, moving away from attempting to break encryption. CISA urges high-risk individuals to adopt superior security measures. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2025/12/cisa-warns-of-rising-targeted-spyware.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
