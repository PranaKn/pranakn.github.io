  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>XSpeeder AI-discovered Zero-Day (CVE-2025-54322)</strong>: Researchers at pwn.ai used autonomous AI agents to find a critical 10.0-rated flaw in XSpeeder networking devices. The vulnerability in <code>vLogin.py</code> allows unauthenticated root access via base64-encoded Python injection in the <code>chkid</code> parameter. Despite seven months of warnings, the vendor hasn't issued a patch, leaving 70,000 industrial devices exposed. CISA also recently added React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182), another AI-identified RCE, to its KEV catalog. <a href="https://hackread.com/xspeeder-0day-flaw-devices-vendor-ignores-alert/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Fortinet 5-Year-Old 2FA Bypass (CVE-2020-12812)</strong>: Threat actors are actively exploiting a half-decade-old flaw in FortiOS SSL VPN to bypass two-factor authentication. The issue stems from inconsistent case-sensitivity in LDAP-linked usernames (e.g., "Admin" vs "admin"). This resurgence follows the addition of two new FortiWeb zero-days (CVE-2025-64446 and CVE-2025-58034) to the CISA KEV Catalog, which enable unauthorized admin accounts and OS command injection. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-5-year-old-fortios-2fa-bypass-still-exploited-in-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>KMSAuto Clipper Malware Campaign</strong>: A Lithuanian national was extradited to South Korea for distributing clipper malware disguised as the KMSAuto Windows activator. Between 2020 and 2023, the suspect infected 2.8 million systems, stealing $1.2 million by swapping cryptocurrency wallet addresses in user clipboards. Forensic evidence from a 2025 arrest in Georgia confirmed 8,400 successful thefts, highlighting the extreme risk of using pirated software activators. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-arrested-for-kmsauto-malware-campaign-with-28-million-downloads/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Mustang Panda deploys ToneShell with Rootkit</strong>: The China-linked group Mustang Panda is targeting Southeast Asian governments with a new ToneShell variant using a kernel-mode rootkit (<code>ProjectConfiguration.sys</code>). The signed driver intercepts file operations and disables Microsoft Defender to protect user-mode payloads. Recent updates include fake TLS headers for network obfuscation. Because it uses sophisticated evasion, memory forensics is now required for effective detection. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-hackers-use-rootkit-to-hide-toneshell-malware-activity/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Cloud Phishing Abuse</strong>: Attackers are abusing the Google Cloud Application Integration service to send 9,394 malicious emails to over 3,200 organizations worldwide. By using the legitimate <code>noreply-application-integration@google.com</code> address, the campaign bypasses security filters. The multi-stage attack uses fake CAPTCHAs and <code>googleusercontent.com</code> to harvest Microsoft credentials. This follows a broader trend of exploiting trusted enterprise infrastructure. <a href="https://hackread.com/google-phishing-3000-global-organisations/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Crypto-Phishing Surge in 2025</strong>: Cryptocurrency-related phishing detections rose by 83.4% this year, with social engineering driving 40% of cases. Prevalent tactics include "approval phishing" (malicious smart contracts) and "address poisoning." CISA KEV additions like the Outlook MonikerLink flaw (CVE-2024-21413) demonstrate how attackers are now chaining zero-interaction vulnerabilities to steal NTLM credentials for crypto-theft. <a href="https://hackread.com/how-to-spot-crypto-phishing-scams/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coupang $1.17B Breach Compensation</strong>: South Korean giant Coupang is paying out over $1 billion to 33.7 million customers after an insider-driven breach. A former IT employee used unrevoked cryptographic keys to access account data over five months. While payment data was safe, hardware recovered from a river confirmed the theft of order histories. The incident underscores the severe risk of "zombie" credentials and poor offboarding procedures. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coupang-to-split-117-billion-among-337-million-data-breach-victims/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Romania’s Oltenia Energy Complex Ransomware</strong>: The "Gentlemen" ransomware group hit Romania's critical power utility on Dec 26, disrupting ERP and email systems. While energy production remained stable, the group utilized "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) tactics to encrypt the domain. The group is known for abusing Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and targeting internet-facing FortiGate VPNs, representing a growing threat to national infrastructure. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/186290/cyber-crime/romanias-oltenia-energy-complex-suffers-major-ransomware-attack.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Trust Wallet Supply Chain Attack</strong>: A compromised Chrome Web Store API key allowed attackers to push a malicious version (2.68.0) of the Trust Wallet extension. The tampered version exfiltrated $7 million from nearly 3,000 wallets by stealing mnemonic phrases. Trust Wallet has since revoked the keys and urged users to update to version 2.69.0. This highlights the fragility of the browser extension ecosystem and its API security. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trust-wallet-says-7-million-crypto-theft-attack-drained-2-596-wallets/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Korean Air/KC&D Data Theft</strong>: Korean Air confirmed a breach of 30,000 employee records after its catering supplier was hacked. The Clop ransomware group exploited a critical zero-day in Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61882) to perform unauthenticated RCE. This vulnerability, added to the CISA KEV Catalog in October, has led to mass data exfiltration of bank account numbers and personal details across several global industries. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/korean-air-data-breach-exposes-data-of-thousands-of-employees/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
