     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Fortinet FortiCloud SSO Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-59718/59719)</strong>: Fortinet is urging customers to patch two critical-severity authentication bypass vulnerabilities, actively being exploited in the wild. Both flaws stem from improper verification of cryptographic signatures in SAML messages, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to bypass FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) login on FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, and FortiWeb products. Attackers are leveraging malicious SSO logins to gain administrative access and exfiltrate critical system configuration files. CISA added both CVEs to its KEV Catalog, mandating immediate remediation for federal agencies. Fortinet advises disabling the FortiCloud SSO login feature as a temporary mitigation. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-newly-patched-fortinet-auth-bypass-flaws/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows LPE/DoS (CVE-2025-34352)</strong>: A critical vulnerability in the JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows agent (versions before 0.317.0) enables local privilege escalation (LPE) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The flaw is in the agent's uninstaller, which runs with SYSTEM privileges but performs unsafe file operations in the user-writable TEMP directory. A low-privileged local attacker can abuse symbolic links to coerce arbitrary file writes to protected system locations, leading to full system control or a Blue Screen of Death. JumpCloud has released version 0.317.0 to patch the high-risk LPE vector. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/jumpcloud-windows-agent-flaw/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Windows Object Manager Race Condition Exploitation Technique</strong>: Google’s Project Zero detailed a new technique to exploit Windows race conditions by pathologically increasing the time of an Object Manager resource lookup from $2\mu s$ to approximately 3 minutes. The method combines deep path traversal using **Shadow Directories**, **hash collision injection** (exploiting the simple `ObpLookupDirectoryEntry` algorithm), and Symbolic Link chaining to create a near-infinite loop in lookup time. This dramatic expansion of the race window makes previously unexploitable Local Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities practical. <a href="https://projectzero.google/2025/12/windows-exploitation-techniques.html" target="_blank">More info</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tyranid/poc-gtfo-13-poc" target="_blank">PoC</a></li>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Sandworm (APT44) targets Western critical infrastructure via misconfigurations</strong>: Amazon Threat Intelligence disrupted a years-long operation attributed to the Russian GRU, known as Sandworm, targeting Western critical infrastructure, particularly the energy sector. Since 2021, the group has shifted from exploiting vulnerabilities to leveraging customer misconfigurations on cloud-hosted network edge devices (routers/VPNs). This "low-hanging fruit" approach allows them to harvest credentials via passive packet capture for replay attacks against victim online services. Amazon notified impacted customers and mitigated the espionage campaign. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-disrupts-russian-gru-hackers-attacking-edge-network-devices/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>'GhostPoster' campaign compromises 17 Firefox extensions via steganography</strong>: The 'GhostPoster' campaign compromises over 17 popular Firefox extensions (50,000+ installs) by concealing a JavaScript loader within the PNG logo file using steganography, evading static analysis. The loader, which is stealthy and only fetches the main payload 10% of the time, grants persistent high-privilege browser access. The final payload enables financial fraud by hijacking affiliate links on e-commerce sites, injecting Google Analytics, and performing ad fraud via invisible iframes. Users must immediately remove the listed malicious extensions. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ghostposter-attacks-hide-malicious-javascript-in-firefox-addon-logos/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Typosquatting NuGet package steals cryptocurrency wallets</strong>: A malicious NuGet package, `Tracer.Fody.NLog`, was discovered to have been typosquatting the legitimate "Tracer.Fody" library for nearly six years. With over 2,000 downloads, the package impersonated the original author and functioned as a cryptocurrency wallet stealer. It scans the default Stratis wallet directory on Windows for `*.wallet.json` files and passwords, exfiltrating the data to a Russian-hosted IP address. This is a recurring pattern of supply chain abuse in the .NET ecosystem by the same infrastructure. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/rogue-nuget-package-poses-as-tracerfody.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Sharp escalation in Android threats in 2025</strong>: Android threats saw a sharp escalation in 2025, driven by sophisticated, multi-component attack frameworks. Comparing the two halves of the year, **adware nearly doubled (90% increase)**, **Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) rose by 66-75%**, and **malware detections grew by about 20%**. For the full year, malware and PUPs accounted for nearly **90%** of all detections (Malware: 43%, PUPs: 45%). Legacy threats like the MobiDash adware family and the Triada Remote Access Trojan detections **more than doubled** in the second half of the year, signaling a shift toward quiet, organized data harvesting. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/mobile/2025/12/android-threats-in-2025-when-your-phone-becomes-the-main-attack-surface" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Compromised IAM credentials powering large-scale AWS cryptomining</strong>: An ongoing campaign is leveraging compromised IAM credentials with high privileges to execute a multi-stage cryptocurrency mining attack targeting AWS customer environments. Within ten minutes of initial access, the actor uses the `RunInstances` "DryRun" flag for reconnaissance, creates dozens of ECS clusters using a malicious DockerHub image, and utilizes autoscaling groups to maximize resource consumption on high-performance instances. A key persistence technique involves setting the `disableApiTermination` parameter to "True" to disrupt incident response. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/compromised-iam-credentials-power-large-scale-aws-cryptomining.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Over 90% of parked domains now redirect to malicious content</strong>: A study by Infoblox reveals that **over 90%** of traffic to "parked" domains, including expired and typosquatting URLs, now redirects users to malicious content, scams, or malware. The malicious redirection is often conditional, profiling visitors based on their IP address—showing benign pages to VPN users and illicit content to residential IPs. Threat actors are utilizing typosquatted domains for email interception and Business Email Compromise, facilitated by affiliate networks exploiting the domain monetization model. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/most-parked-domains-now-serving-malicious-content/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
