  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>China Researches Disruption of LEO Satellite Constellations</strong>: Chinese academic research indicates a focus on disrupting hostile **low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations** like Starlink, recognizing their strategic importance. The paper estimates that jamming a Taiwan-sized region would require **1,000 to 2,000 drones**, confirming the feasibility of electronic warfare. Experts believe disrupting satellite connectivity would be an early tactic in any future Asian conflict, with cyber- and electronic-warfare attacks favored over kinetic ones due to lower escalation risk. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/china-researches-ways-disrupt-satellite-internet" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>MuddyWater’s New Fooder Loader and MuddyViper Backdoor</strong>: The Iran-aligned cyberespionage group **MuddyWater (TA450)** has launched a more sophisticated campaign targeting organizations in **Israel and Egypt** across technology, government, and utilities. Attackers deployed new custom tools to improve evasion, including the **Fooder loader** (sometimes disguised as a Snake game) which implements execution delays. Fooder reflectively loads the new C/C++ backdoor, **MuddyViper**, providing system reconnaissance, file operations, command execution, and stealing credentials using a fake Windows Security dialog. The malware uniquely utilizes the CNG Windows cryptographic API, continuing MuddyWater's focus on cyberespionage against critical infrastructure. <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/muddywater-snakes-riverbank/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Water Saci Banking Malware Campaign Evolves with Python</strong>: The **Water Saci banking malware** campaign targeting Brazil has evolved, adopting a sophisticated, multi-format attack chain delivered primarily via **WhatsApp**. A key development is the shift from a PowerShell-based propagation routine to a **Python variant (whatsz.py)**, suggested to be an AI-assisted port with enhanced features. The multi-stage infection uses a malicious HTA file to drop an MSI installer, which utilizes a compiled AutoIt script for anti-VM checks and system reconnaissance, specifically targeting Brazilian banking applications. The banking trojan, similar to the Casbaneiro lineage, is ultimately loaded into a hollowed **svchost.exe** process, using an IMAP-based mechanism for secondary C&C updates. <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/l/water-saci.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Shai-Hulud 2.0 NPM Attack Steals 400,000 Developer Secrets</strong>: The second **Shai-Hulud** attack compromised over **800 NPM packages** with a self-propagating malicious script, resulting in the publication of approximately **400,000 raw secrets** across 30,000 GitHub repositories. This supply chain worm used the **TruffleHog scanning tool** to automatically harvest secrets, including GitHub, NPM, and cloud credentials. Over **60% of the leaked NPM tokens remained valid** as of December 1st, posing an active risk. The attack propagated via the *preinstall* event, and the payload included a destructive mechanism to wipe the victim’s home directory if exfiltration failed. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shai-hulud-20-npm-malware-attack-exposed-up-to-400-000-dev-secrets/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ShadyPanda Executes Seven-Year "Sleeper Agent" Browser Extension Spyware</strong>: The China-linked **ShadyPanda** group executed a sophisticated, seven-year "sleeper agent" browser extension campaign, secretly compromising an estimated **4.3 million Chrome and Edge users**. The five malicious extensions, which had built trust since 2018, received silent, weaponized updates in mid-2024. These updates introduced an **RCE framework**, allowing the extensions to hourly download and execute arbitrary JavaScript, exfiltrating encrypted browsing history, tracking every visited URL, and collecting complete browser fingerprints. The **WeTab** extension alone accounted for roughly three million installs on Edge. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/sleeper-browser-extensions-woke-up-as-spyware-on-4-million-devices" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
