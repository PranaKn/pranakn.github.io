     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Google's December Android Security Update patches 107 defects, including two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities</strong>: Google's December Android Security Update patches 107 defects, including two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, **CVE-2025-48633** and **CVE-2025-48572**, affecting the Android framework. These high-severity flaws can be exploited for information access and privilege escalation, respectively, and Google noted they may be under limited, targeted exploitation, likely involving malicious spyware. The update also addresses a critical remote denial of service vulnerability, **CVE-2025-48631**, in the framework. Immediate patching is required via the two security patch levels, 2025-12-01 and 2025-12-05. <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/android-security-update-december-2025/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>SmartTube YouTube client for Android TV breached to push malicious update</strong>: The popular open-source **SmartTube YouTube client for Android TV** was compromised after an attacker gained access to the developer's signing keys, pushing a malicious update (version 30.51) to users. The developer confirmed the compromise, which led to Google Play Protect blocking the application. Reverse engineering revealed an injected, unapproved native library, **libalphasdk.so**, which runs silently, fingerprints the device, and periodically **exfiltrates device metrics** via an encrypted channel. Users are urged to avoid the compromised builds and reset Google account passwords. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smarttube-youtube-app-for-android-tv-breached-to-push-malicious-update/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>ShadyPanda campaign infected 4.3 million Chrome/Edge users via malicious extensions</strong>: A sophisticated, multi-year campaign, dubbed **ShadyPanda**, infected **4.3 million Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge users** via seemingly legitimate browser extensions that were later updated with backdoors and spyware. The operation involved publishing benign productivity tools, gaining a large user base, and then pushing a malicious update capable of complete browser surveillance, **data exfiltration to servers in China**, and anti-analysis features. The malware, found in extensions like "Clean Master," steals visited URLs, search queries, and fingerprints, enabling remote code execution. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/chrome_edge_malicious_browser_extensions/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Glassworm malware returns in third wave of malicious VS Code packages</strong>: The **Glassworm** campaign has re-emerged in its third wave, adding **24 new malicious packages** across the OpenVSX and Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplaces, targeting developers using VS Code-compatible editors. The malware uses **invisible Unicode characters** to hide its Rust-based implant and bypass code review. Upon installation, the extension attempts to steal **GitHub, npm, and OpenVSX credentials**, along with cryptocurrency wallet data. Glassworm establishes a SOCKS proxy and installs an **HVNC client** for stealthy remote access, turning the developer's machine into criminal infrastructure. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/glassworm-malware-returns-in-third-wave-of-malicious-vs-code-packages/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Police disrupt Cryptomixer, seizing €25M and 12TB of data</strong>: German and Swiss law enforcement, with support from Europol, successfully disrupted "**Cryptomixer**," a major cryptocurrency mixing service accused of **laundering over €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion)** in illicit funds since 2016. The hybrid service was a preferred tool for ransomware groups, dark web markets, and other cybercriminals. The operation, conducted between November 24 and 28, resulted in the seizure of three servers, the `cryptomixer.io` domain, **12TB of data**, and more than **€25 million in Bitcoin**. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/police-disrupt-cryptomixer-seize-millions-crypto" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Albiriox Android MaaS malware focuses on On-Device Fraud (ODF)</strong>: **Albiriox** is a new, rapidly maturing Android **Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)** advertised on Russian-speaking forums, specializing in On-Device Fraud (ODF) and full device takeover. Sold for $720/month, it targets over **400 banking and cryptocurrency applications** globally. Its core feature is a **VNC-based remote access module** that uses accessibility services to enable real-time screen streaming, UI automation, and fraudulent transactions, bypassing traditional authentication. Developers prioritize evasion, offering integration with crypting services. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/android-maas-malware-albiriox-dark/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Arkanix Stealer uses C++ and 'Chrome Elevator' to defeat Google's App Bound Encryption</strong>: **Arkanix** is a new, rapidly developed information stealer, initially Python-based and quickly implemented in C++, that is distributed on Discord and sold via a web panel. The malware targets a broad range of sensitive data, including credentials from multiple Chromium-based browsers, a long list of crypto/wallet browser extensions (e.g., MetaMask), and specific crypto wallets like Exodus. The C++ "Premium" version utilizes a tool called **'Chrome Elevator' to defeat Google's App Bound Encryption (ABE)** in browsers like Chrome and Edge by injecting code into the browser process to extract data. <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/12/38306-arkanix-stealer" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
