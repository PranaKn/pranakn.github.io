     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenPLC ScadaBR XSS Added to CISA KEV (CVE-2021-26829)</strong>: CISA added an actively exploited Cross-site Scripting (XSS) flaw in **OpenPLC ScadaBR** to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. The vulnerability, which affects Windows (through v1.12.4) and Linux (through v0.9.1) via <code>system_settings.shtm</code>, is a critical risk for industrial control systems. Exploitation evidence includes a September 2025 incident where the pro-Russian group TwoNet used the flaw to deface the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) login page and disable alarms after gaining initial access. Federal agencies must remediate by December 19, 2025. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/28/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Microsoft Teams Guest Access Bypass Microsoft Defender Protections</strong>: Researchers identified a cross-tenant **"blind spot"** in **Microsoft Teams' guest access**, allowing attackers to bypass **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** protections. When a user accepts a guest invitation to an external tenant, their security is governed by the hosting environment's policies, which an attacker can set to be protection-free. The attacker's initial invitation bypasses SPF/DKIM checks, and subsequently sent phishing links or malware attachments avoid the victim's Safe Links/Attachments scans. Mitigation requires restricting B2B collaboration to trusted domains and implementing cross-tenant access controls. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/ms-teams-guest-access-can-remove.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>North Korea's Contagious Interview Campaign Uses 197 New NPM Packages</strong>: North Korea-linked threat actors have escalated the **Contagious Interview** supply chain attack, adding **197 new malicious npm packages** to distribute an updated **OtterCookie infostealer**. The campaign targets software developers, especially in crypto and Web3, on Windows, Linux, and macOS via social engineering (fake job interviews). The new packages, like the typosquatted <code>tailwind-magic</code>, use a postinstall script to fetch and execute the OtterCookie payload from a Vercel staging site. OtterCookie performs keylogging, clipboard theft, screenshot capture, and credential/wallet harvesting while checking for VMs. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/185170/apt/contagious-interview-campaign-expands-with-197-npm-ppackages-spreading-new-ottercookie-malware.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Man Sentenced 7 Years for 'Evil Twin' WiFi Attacks at Airports</strong>: A 44-year-old Australian man received a **seven-year and four-month** prison sentence for running an **"evil twin" WiFi network** at airports (Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide) and during flights to steal traveler credentials. Using a **WiFi Pineapple** device, he set up rogue access points with SSIDs identical to legitimate networks, directing unsuspecting users to phishing pages to steal social media credentials. He then used the access to steal intimate images and videos from women's private accounts. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/man-behind-in-flight-evil-twin-wifi-attacks-gets-7-years-in-prison/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Adversarial Poetry Jailbreaks Frontier LLMs</strong>: A new paper details that **adversarial poetry** functions as a universal, single-turn **jailbreak technique**, circumventing safety guardrails across **25 frontier LLMs**, with some providers seeing an Attack Success Rate (ASR) over 90%. The technique reformats harmful requests into verse, using metaphor and stylistic variation to disrupt safety heuristics. Hand-crafted poems achieved an average ASR of 62%, and automated poetic conversions achieved 43% (up to 18 times higher than prose baselines), demonstrating a fundamental vulnerability in current alignment methods sensitive to linguistic style over semantic intent. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/prompt-injection-through-poetry.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Ransomware Payments Ban Proposed in the UK Amid 126% Surge</strong>: Ransomware incidents surged by **126%** in Q1 2025, fueling a debate over paying attackers (admitted by 41% of organizations). The **UK government** has proposed a ban on these payments, initially for public sector and **Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)** organizations, to eliminate the financial incentive for cybercriminals. The proposal aims to force organizations to prioritize robust cyber resilience, comprehensive incident response, and recovery capabilities, though experts warn it necessitates advanced security investment to prevent catastrophic business disruption. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2025/11/uks-proposed-ban-on-ransomware-payments.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Threat Actors Exploit Digital Calendar Subscriptions for Phishing</strong>: Threat actors are exploiting **digital calendar subscriptions** as an overlooked attack vector, leveraging third-party server functionality to push malicious content directly to user devices. BitSight research found nearly four million devices still making daily synchronization requests to sinkholed domains. By registering expired calendar domains, attackers can serve customized **.ics files** containing phishing links, malware URLs, and scripts without user approval, bypassing traditional email filters and creating a dangerous blind spot. Users should review and remove unfamiliar calendar subscriptions and treat all calendar links as suspicious. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/threat-actors-exploit-calendar-subs/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
