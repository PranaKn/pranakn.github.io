    <h2>VULNERABILITIES</h2>

    <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added CVE-2025-31161, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 to 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 to 11.3.0, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate users, including administrators, potentially leading to full system compromise. Exploitation has been observed in the wild since March 2025. CrushFTP has released patches; users should upgrade to versions 10.8.4 or 11.3.1 or later immediately. If immediate patching isn't possible, enabling the DMZ proxy can serve as a temporary mitigation.</p>

    <p>Google's April 2025 Android update patches 62 vulnerabilities, including two zero-days exploited in targeted attacks. One, CVE-2024-53197, is a high-severity privilege escalation flaw in the Linux kernel's USB-audio driver, reportedly used by Serbian authorities via Cellebrite's zero-day exploit chain to unlock Android devices. This chain also included zero-days CVE-2024-53104 and CVE-2024-50302. The second zero-day, CVE-2024-53150, involves an Android kernel information disclosure bug. Amnesty International uncovered the exploit in 2024. Fixes were shared with OEMs in January. Google Pixel devices received updates immediately; others may face delays. This follows a similar NoviSpy spyware exploit fixed in November 2024.</p>

    <h2>ADVERSARIES</h2>

    <p>Researchers have uncovered nine malicious VSCode extensions on Microsoft's Marketplace that infect users with the XMRig cryptominer to mine Ethereum and Monero. Disguised as legitimate tools like "Discord Rich Presence" and "Solidity Compiler," these extensions‚Äîpublished April 4, 2025‚Äîhave over 300,000 installs, likely inflated to appear credible. Upon installation, they execute a PowerShell script that disables security features, establishes persistence, and downloads XMRig from a remote server. The malware also mimics system binaries for privilege escalation. Despite reports to Microsoft, the extensions remain online. Users are urged to uninstall them and remove associated malware components immediately.</p>

    <p>The Everest ransomware gang's dark web leak site was hacked over the weekend by an unknown attacker who defaced it with a message mocking cybercrime. The site, now offline, showed "Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague" before disappearing entirely. Experts suspect a WordPress vulnerability may have enabled the breach. Everest, active since 2020, has targeted over 230 victims using double-extortion tactics and has also acted as an initial access broker. Its recent victims include cannabis brand STIIIZY and several U.S. healthcare organizations, prompting warnings from the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

    <p>The Chinese-linked APT group ToddyCat is exploiting CVE-2024-11859, a DLL search order hijacking flaw in ESET antivirus software, to execute stealthy malware dubbed TCESB. Discovered by Kaspersky, the malicious <code>version.dll</code> mimics the legitimate Windows library to silently run in the background, bypassing detection and disabling security alerts at the kernel level. Despite ESET patching the flaw in January 2025, ToddyCat continues targeting systems using unpatched versions. The group also abuses CVE-2021-36276 in a Dell driver to escalate privileges. Experts recommend monitoring vulnerable driver installs and suspicious kernel debug activity to detect and prevent such sophisticated threats.</p>

    <p>A tampered version of Sysinternals' BGInfo.exe has been weaponized to deploy the Vidar Stealer malware. Though it mirrors the legitimate file in metadata and versioning (4.33), the malicious version differs in size (2.1 MiB vs. 10.2 MiB) and hash, and fails to update the desktop wallpaper‚Äîa key BGInfo function. The malware modifies BGInfo‚Äôs heap initialization to hijack execution, allocating memory for further stages via <code>VirtualAlloc</code>, ultimately loading and running Vidar. The stealer‚Äôs payload, extracted as <code>vidardump.bin</code>, targets credentials, wallets, and session tokens from apps like FileZilla, Telegram, and Brave, and hijacks thread execution via <code>RtlUserThreadStart</code>.</p>

    <p>Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old from Florida and member of the Scattered Spider hacking gang, has pleaded guilty to SIM swap fraud, identity theft, and stealing $800,000 in cryptocurrency from five investors. Known online as "King Bob," Urban also leaked unreleased music by artists like Ariana Grande and Playboi Carti after breaching music executives‚Äô accounts. Scattered Spider is infamous for high-profile hacks, including MGM Resorts, using social engineering and impersonation tactics. Urban was arrested in January 2024 and attempted to erase evidence during the raid. He faces sentencing within 75 days and owes $13 million in restitution to 59 victims.</p>

    <p>A new Neptune RAT variant is spreading through YouTube and Telegram, targeting Windows users with capabilities to steal credentials, hijack cryptocurrency wallets, and deploy ransomware. Promoted as the ‚ÄúMost Advanced RAT,‚Äù the malware is disguised as a legitimate tool but enables attackers to encrypt files, corrupt system components, and maintain persistence. It uses obfuscation techniques, such as Arabic characters and emojis, to evade detection and includes modules for clipboard monitoring, task scheduling, and screen viewing. Distributed via platforms like GitHub and catbox.moe, Neptune RAT highlights the growing threat of malware shared freely under false ethical pretenses.</p>

    <p>Meridian Group has exposed the rise of ‚ÄúEDR-as-a-Service,‚Äù where cybercriminals exploit compromised law enforcement accounts to submit fraudulent Emergency Data Requests (EDRs) to major platforms, gaining sensitive user data. This turnkey black-market service now includes submitting fake EDRs and delivering stolen data. Transactions are arranged via dark web forums and encrypted apps, with payments in crypto and escrow systems for trust. Manuals help even low-skilled actors exploit this method, posing serious risks to journalists, politicians, and the public. Meridian urges tech firms to overhaul EDR verification to safeguard privacy and prevent systemic abuse.</p>

    <h2>TRENDS</h2>

    <p>Cybersecurity firm SlashNext has uncovered a sophisticated new AI toolkit named <b>Xanthorox AI</b>, circulating in cybercrime forums since Q1 2025. Unlike prior malicious tools like WormGPT, Xanthorox is built on five proprietary AI models hosted on private infrastructure. It offers modular capabilities, including code generation, visual analysis, voice control, vulnerability exploitation, and live internet scraping. Experts warn it marks a leap in AI-driven cybercrime, underscoring the need for AI-based behavioral detection and advanced threat monitoring systems.</p>
