  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cisco fixes critical AsyncOS zero-day (CVE-2025-20393)</strong>: Cisco released critical updates for Email Security Gateway and Secure Email Manager to address a CVSS 10.0 vulnerability. Attributed to China-linked actor UAT-9686, the exploit allowed unauthenticated remote root-level command execution. Attackers deployed the "Aqua" malware suite for persistence. Cisco warns that administrators must rebuild compromised appliances from clean images to ensure full eradication. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/01/16/cisco-fixes-asyncos-vulnerability-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks-cve-2025-20393/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GhostPoster campaign hits 840,000 installs</strong>: Researchers identified 17 malicious browser extensions using advanced steganography (hiding code in PNG files) to bypass security analysis. Linked to the "DarkSpectre" actor, the malware performs ad fraud and hijacks affiliate links. The campaign used delayed execution to remain undetected across major browser stores for years. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-ghostposter-browser-extensions-found-with-840-000-installs/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>UAT-8837 targets North American Critical Infrastructure</strong>: A China-nexus group has been exploiting a zero-day (CVE-2025-53690) in Sitecore products. Using tools like Earthworm and Certipy, the group escalates privileges and maps Active Directory environments. Their focus on exfiltrating product-related DLLs suggests preparation for future supply-chain attacks. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/186999/breaking-news/china-linked-apt-uat-8837-targets-north-american-critical-infrastructure.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>StealC malware panels hijacked by researchers</strong>: CyberArk exploited an XSS vulnerability in the StealC info-stealer admin panel to monitor attackers. They identified a Russian-speaking operator in Ukraine, "YouTubeTA," who compromised 5,000 victims and stole 390,000 passwords via cracked software lures on YouTube. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/stealc-hackers-hacked-as-researchers-hijack-malware-control-panels/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enterprise HR platforms targeted by Chrome extensions</strong>: Malicious extensions masquerading as productivity tools targeted Workday, NetSuite, and SAP SuccessFactors. By stealing session tokens every 60 seconds, attackers bypassed MFA. The malware also hid security administration pages from legitimate admins to prevent incident response. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credential-stealing-chrome-extensions-target-enterprise-hr-platforms/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
