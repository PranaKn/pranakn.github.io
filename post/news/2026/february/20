  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windows Admin Center Privilege Escalation (CVE-2026-26119)</strong>: Microsoft disclosed a high-severity flaw (CVSS 8.8) in its WAC management suite caused by improper authentication. An authorized network attacker can elevate permissions to match the WAC application user, potentially leading to full domain compromise and lateral movement. Microsoft has flagged this with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment and urges immediate updates for self-hosted instances. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/microsoft-patches-cve-2026-26119.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Grandstream VoIP Stack Overflow (CVE-2026-2329)</strong>: Rapid7 identified a critical (CVSS 9.3) unauthenticated buffer overflow in Grandstream GXP1600 series phones. Attackers can exploit the <code>/cgi-bin/api.values.get</code> endpoint to gain root privileges, enabling remote code execution, eavesdropping, and credential theft. Users should update to firmware 1.0.7.81 or later immediately. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaw-in-grandstream-voip-phones-allows-stealthy-eavesdropping/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SmartLoader targets AI Developers</strong>: Researchers found a campaign using the SmartLoader framework to deploy StealC malware via a counterfeit Oura Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. By faking GitHub activity and listing on the MCP Market, attackers aim to harvest API keys and crypto wallets from developers rather than general consumers. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2026/02/hackers-use-fake-oura-ai-server-to.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>TrustConnect RAT-as-a-Service</strong>: Proofpoint uncovered a fraudulent RMM vendor, TrustConnect, offering full remote access for $300/month. Using AI-generated websites and legitimate EV certificates to appear authentic, the operators (formerly Redline customers) use phishing lures like tax docs to deploy the malware. They are currently rebranding as "DocConnect" to evade disruptions. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/rmm_rat_trustconnect/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>PromptSpy: AI-Driven Android Malware</strong>: ESET identified the first Android malware to use Google’s Gemini model at runtime. PromptSpy processes UI XML dumps to dynamically adapt persistence mechanisms, such as "pinning" itself in the Recent Apps list. It includes VNC remote control and invisible overlays to prevent uninstallation. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/promptspy-is-the-first-known-android-malware-to-use-generative-ai-at-runtime/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ShinyHunters OAuth Vishing</strong>: Attackers are targeting Microsoft Entra accounts by abusing the Device Authorization flow. By posing as IT support and tricking users into entering codes on legitimate Microsoft pages, they bypass MFA to secure persistent refresh tokens for corporate SaaS apps without needing their own phishing infra. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-microsoft-entra-accounts-in-device-code-vishing-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Venice Security Platform Launch</strong>: Emerging from stealth with $33M, Venice Security (formerly Valkyrie) launched a platform focused on a zero-standing-access model. It provides just-in-time access across hybrid environments to reduce the attack surface created by permanent administrative privileges. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/venice-security-emerges-from-stealth-with-33m-funding-for-privileged-access-management/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Predator Spyware targets Angolan Press</strong>: Amnesty International confirmed that journalist Teixeira Cândido was infected with Intellexa’s Predator spyware. The attack used a malicious WhatsApp link and targeted an outdated iOS device, masking itself as "iconservicesagent" to grant total access to the victim's data and hardware. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/188215/malware/intellexas-predator-spyware-infected-angolan-journalists-device-amnesty-reports.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cline AI Supply Chain Attack</strong>: The npm package for Cline, an AI coding tool, was compromised via a prompt injection vulnerability in its GitHub workflow. Attackers released a poisoned version (2.3.0) containing the OpenClaw framework, which establishes a persistent WebSocket gateway. Users are urged to move to version 2.4.0. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/supply-chain-attack-openclaw-cline-users" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Starkiller Phishing-as-a-Service</strong>: A new platform, Starkiller, uses Docker and headless Chrome to proxy actual websites in real-time. This bypasses static detection and "template drift," allowing attackers to capture MFA session tokens easily via a user-friendly dashboard. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/starkiller-phishing-kit-mfa" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Infostealers targeting AI Identity Files</strong>: Hudson Rock reported an infection targeting the OpenClaw AI framework. The malware exfiltrated <code>.openclaw</code> directories, containing "digital blueprints" like context logs and gateway tokens, allowing attackers to bypass safety checks and impersonate victims' AI identities. <a href="https://hackread.com/infostealer-steal-openclaw-ai-identity-memory-files/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Massiv Android Banking Malware</strong>: Posing as IPTV apps, "Massiv" uses Accessibility Services and MediaProjection to perform screen overlays and keylogging. It has been used in Portugal to bypass KYC checks and open fraudulent bank accounts in victims' names. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-massiv-android-banking-malware-poses-as-an-iptv-app/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flickr Third-Party Email Breach</strong>: Flickr disclosed a breach involving a third-party email provider that potentially exposed PII for some of its 35 million monthly users. Exposed data includes names, emails, and IP addresses, though passwords and financial data remain secure. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2026/02/flickr-discloses-third-party-breach.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔍 Hunting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Arkanix Stealer MaaS</strong>: Kaspersky identified "Arkanix," a new MaaS info-stealer targeting 22 browsers, crypto wallets, and VPN accounts. Developed with suspected AI assistance, it features both Python and C++ versions and was distributed via phishing campaigns before being taken down in late 2025. <a href="https://securelist.com/arkanix-stealer/119006/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERPOL Operation Red Card 2.0</strong>: An eight-week operation across 16 African nations led to 651 arrests and the recovery of $4.3 million. The initiative targeted mobile money fraud and investment scams, dismantling over 1,400 malicious servers. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/interpol-operation-red-card-20-arrests.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Microsoft Exposure Management Guide</strong>: Microsoft released a new strategic guide for proactive defense, moving from reactive patching to risk-driven visibility. The framework, featuring five maturity levels, will be a primary focus at the upcoming RSAC 2026. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/19/new-e-book-establishing-a-proactive-defense-with-microsoft-security-exposure-management/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
