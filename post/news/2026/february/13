  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BeyondTrust RCE exploitation (CVE-2026-1731)</strong>: BeyondTrust confirmed active exploitation of a 9.9 CVSS flaw in its Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access appliances. The pre-auth RCE allows attackers to execute OS commands via the <code>/get_portal_info</code> endpoint. While SaaS instances were patched on Feb 2, about 8,500 on-prem deployments remain at risk. Organizations are urged to upgrade to Remote Support 25.3.2 or PRA 25.1.1 immediately. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-beyondtrust-rce-flaw-now-exploited-in-attacks-patch-now/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Windows LNK spoofing techniques</strong>: Researcher Wietze Beukema unveiled four ways to manipulate LNK files to hide malicious payloads. By exploiting how Windows Explorer parses data blocks, attackers can show a "clean" path (like a PDF) while executing PowerShell. Despite similar flaws (CVE-2025-9491) being used by state actors for PlugX malware, Microsoft declined to classify these as vulnerabilities due to required user interaction. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-new-windows-lnk-spoofing-issues-arent-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>CISA adds four flaws to KEV Catalog</strong>: CISA expanded its KEV list with critical vulnerabilities including a Microsoft Config Manager SQL injection (CVE-2024-43468), a Notepad++ MiTM flaw (CVE-2025-15556), a SolarWinds Web Help Desk bypass (CVE-2025-40536), and a sophisticated Apple zero-day (CVE-2026-20700). Federal agencies must remediate these immediately to close entry points for state and criminal actors. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/02/12/cisa-adds-four-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Critical RCE in WPvivid Backup (CVE-2026-1357)</strong>: A 9.8 CVSS flaw impacts over 900,000 WordPress sites using the WPvivid plugin. Improper RSA error handling and lack of sanitization allow unauthenticated RCE via directory traversal and file uploads. Exploitation requires the "receive backup" feature to be active. Admins should upgrade to version 0.9.124. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wordpress-plugin-with-900k-installs-vulnerable-to-critical-rce-flaw/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Odido/Ben data breach hits 6.2M users</strong>: Dutch provider Odido confirmed a breach where hackers accessed names, addresses, IBANs, and ID numbers for 6.2 million customers. The infiltration occurred via a contact system over the weekend of Feb 7. While PII was taken, core credentials like passwords and billing data remained secure. External experts have been engaged for defense. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/187927/uncategorized/odido-confirms-massive-breach-6-2-million-customers-impacted.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) evolution</strong>: AMOS has moved to a multi-stage MaaS model ($1,000/mo). Recent "ClawHavoc" campaigns poisoned AI assistant ecosystems (OpenClaw/ClawHub), while "ClickFix" attacks used poisoned ChatGPT chats to trick users into running Terminal commands. AMOS targets Keychain passwords, cookies, and crypto wallets. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amos-infostealer-targets-macos-through-a-popular-ai-app/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>AiFrame campaign hides in 30+ Chrome extensions</strong>: Over 300,000 users were impacted by malicious extensions like "Gemini AI Sidebar." Using the backend <code>tapnetic[.]pro</code>, these extensions bypass Google's review process by loading remote iframes. They can extract page content, capture Gmail messages, and use the Web Speech API for unauthorized voice transcriptions. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-ai-chrome-extensions-with-300k-users-steal-credentials-emails/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>World Leaks uses RustyRocket for stealth persistence</strong>: World Leaks (formerly Hunters International) is using a new Rust-based tool called RustyRocket for high-performance exfiltration. The tool uses encrypted tunnels and "execution guardrails" to evade detection. The group recently leaked 1.4TB of data from Nike, prioritizing extortion over encryption. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/world-leaks-ransomware-rustyrocket/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Stanley MaaS bypasses Chrome Web Store reviews</strong>: A new toolkit named Stanley is being sold for up to $6,000, promising to bypass Google’s security reviews. It uses iframe overlays to phish credentials while keeping the legitimate URL in the address bar. The extension "Notely" was identified as a PoC for this service. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2026/02/stanley-malware-service-bypasses-chrome.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>State-sponsored abuse of Gemini AI</strong>: Google GTIG reports that actors from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are using Gemini AI for reconnaissance, phishing lures, and C2 development. Notable activity includes the "HonestCue" framework using AI for C# code generation. While not yet a "breakthrough" capability, it is accelerating attack lifecycles. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-says-hackers-are-abusing-gemini-ai-for-all-attacks-stages/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Lazarus Group "fake recruiter" campaign</strong>: Since May 2025, Lazarus has targeted JS/Python devs using the persona of "Veltrix Capital." Candidates are lured into GitHub coding assessments containing malicious npm/PyPI dependencies (like <code>bigmathutils</code>) that deploy RATs or steal Discord/2FA data. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/lazarus-campaign-plants-malicious.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Qilin ransomware hits Conpet S.A.</strong>: Romania’s national oil pipeline operator suffered a 1TB data theft by the Qilin gang. Administrative systems were paralyzed, and employee passport scans were leaked. Core oil transport operations remain functional, but the DNSC has warned of potential fraud using the stolen PII. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/romanias-oil-pipeline-operator-conpet-confirms-data-stolen-in-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
