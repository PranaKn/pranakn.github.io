  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>27 Vulnerabilities in Cloud Password Managers</strong>: Researchers from ETH Zurich and USI identified flaws in Bitwarden, LastPass, Dashlane, and 1Password, challenging "zero-knowledge" claims. Exploits include key escrow flaws and vault integrity issues that allow compromised servers to bypass E2EE. Bitwarden faced 12 successful attacks, while 1Password’s architecture was the most resilient. Most vendors are currently patching these design anti-patterns. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/vulnerabilities-password-managers/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Google Patches First Chrome Zero-Day of 2026 (CVE-2026-2441)</strong>: A high-severity use-after-free flaw in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap is being exploited in the wild. The bug, caused by iterator invalidation during font processing, can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution. Emergency patches are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux (versions 145.0.7632.75/76 and 144.0.7559.75). <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-patches-first-chrome-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks-this-year/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vidar Variant Targets "AI Souls"</strong>: A new variant of the Vidar infostealer is exfiltrating OpenClaw AI agent configurations, including tokens and behavioral guidelines (soul.md). This allows attackers to hijack local AI instances or impersonate users. OpenClaw has responded by integrating VirusTotal scanning and joining OpenAI as an open-source project to bolster security. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/infostealer-steals-openclaw-ai-agent.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>OysterLoader Evolves for Rhysida Ransomware</strong>: Distributed via fake PuTTY and WinSCP sites, this C++ loader now uses a four-stage chain including steganography and custom LZMA decompression. The malware evades static analysis via non-standard Base64 and dynamic API resolution, facilitating persistent access for ransomware deployment. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/oysterloader-new-c2-infrastructure/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>LockBit 5.0 Targets Enterprise Infrastructure</strong>: The latest RaaS evolution features cross-platform builds for Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi. It utilizes ChaCha20 encryption, ETW patching, and DLL reflection. The ESXi variant is specifically designed to paralyze entire datastores from a single hypervisor foothold, signaling a shift toward high-impact infrastructure targets. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/02/16/lockbit-5-0-ransomware-windows-linux-esxi/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ZeroDayRAT Mobile Spyware on Telegram</strong>: A new commercial spyware platform targets Android (v5–16) and iOS (up to v26). It offers real-time camera/mic feeds and specialized modules for stealing Apple Pay, PayPal, and crypto credentials. Distributed via social engineering, it effectively bypasses 2FA by harvesting OTPs. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/new-zerodayrat-mobile-spyware-enables.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The "Promptware Kill Chain" for LLMs</strong>: Researchers have defined a seven-stage lifecycle for malware targeting Large Language Models. This framework moves beyond simple prompt injection to describe how attackers maintain persistence in AI memory and move laterally through connected services like email and calendars. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/the-promptware-kill-chain.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Washington Hotel Ransomware Attack</strong>: Fujita Kanko Inc. confirmed a breach of its Japanese business infrastructure. While internal business data was accessed and some credit card terminals were disabled, customer data stored on separate third-party servers reportedly remains secure. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/washington-hotel-in-japan-discloses-ransomware-infection-incident/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Eurail Data Auctioned on Dark Web</strong>: Stolen data from the Netherlands-based railway operator, including passport details, IBANs, and health info, is being sold online. Millions of Eurail and Interrail pass holders are advised to reset Rail Planner credentials and monitor for identity theft. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eurail-says-stolen-traveler-data-now-up-for-sale-on-dark-web/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ISO 27001 Compliance in the Passkey Era</strong>: The transition to FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys is significantly reducing credential-based incidents. This shift updates key ISO/IEC 27001 controls, offering a 30% improvement in authentication success while eliminating automated credential stuffing. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/passwords-to-passkeys-staying-iso-27001-compliant-in-a-passwordless-era/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
