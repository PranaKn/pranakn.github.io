  <h1>Cybersecurity Newsfeed</h1>
  <h2>📅 18/02/26</h2>

  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Popular VS Code Extensions Expose 128M Users</strong>: Ox Security identified high-severity and critical flaws in extensions like Live Server (CVE-2025-65717), Code Runner (CVE-2025-65715), and Markdown Preview Enhanced (CVE-2025-65716). These enable RCE and file exfiltration via malicious webpages or crafted Markdown files. While Microsoft patched Live Preview (v0.4.16), other maintainers have been unresponsive. These risks extend to IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaws-in-popular-vscode-extensions-expose-developers-to-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>CISA Adds Four to KEV Catalog</strong>: CISA urged remediation for a high-severity Chrome CSS engine zero-day (CVE-2026-2441) allowing RCE. Also added: TeamT5 ThreatSonar file upload (CVE-2024-7694), Zimbra SSRF (CVE-2020-7796), and a legacy Windows Video ActiveX flaw (CVE-2008-0015) still used by persistent actors. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/02/17/cisa-adds-four-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SmartLoader Targets AI Developer Supply Chain</strong>: STAR Labs uncovered a campaign cloning the Oura MCP server to distribute StealC malware. Attackers used AI-generated GitHub personas to infiltrate public MCP registries, targeting developer credentials and API keys through trojanized servers using LuaJIT obfuscation. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/188135/ai/smartloader-hackers-clone-oura-mcp-project-to-spread-stealc-malware.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Keenadu Android Firmware Trojan</strong>: Kaspersky identified a Trojan infecting 13,000 devices via compromised supply chains. Targeting the "Zygote" process, it injects code into all apps for ad fraud and remote access. It is distributed via pre-loaded firmware and is linked to the BADBOX and Triada botnets. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/mobile-security/supply-chain-attack-embeds-malware-android-devices" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Chinese UNC6201 Exploits Dell Zero-Day</strong>: Since mid-2024, attackers exploited CVE-2026-22769 (hardcoded credentials) in Dell RecoverPoint for root access. They deployed the "Grimbolt" backdoor and used "Ghost NICs" on ESXi servers for stealthy lateral movement. Dell urges an immediate upgrade to 6.0.3.1 HF1. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-exploiting-dell-zero-day-flaw-since-mid-2024/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Fake SSA Emails Deploy ScreenConnect</strong>: A campaign targeting the UK, US, and Canada uses a malicious .cmd script from "SSA.COM" to disable SmartScreen and install a trojanized ScreenConnect (v25.2.4.9229). It uses a revoked certificate and connects to C2 infrastructure in Iran for persistent access. <a href="https://hackread.com/hackers-screenconnect-hijack-pcs-fake-social-security-emails/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rise of "AI-Stealer" Malware</strong>: Hudson Rock noted a shift where malware now harvests "soul" files—AI behavioral contexts and gateway tokens. By stealing OpenClaw configurations, attackers can impersonate digital identities and access local AI instances, marking a transition toward specialized AI-context theft. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/188097/malware/hackers-steal-openclaw-configuration-in-emerging-ai-agent-threat.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>API Threats Surge via MCP</strong>: Wallarm’s 2026 report found that 43% of CISA KEV additions are API-related. MCP vulnerabilities jumped 270% due to over-permissioned tools. Attackers are prioritizing logic abuse and trust failures over traditional code defects in AI infrastructure. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/api-threats-grow-in-scale-as-ai-expands-the-blast-radius/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Atlassian Jira Infrastructure Abused for Spam</strong>: Between Dec 2025 and Jan 2026, actors used legitimate atlassian.net domains to launch automated phishing. By bypassing filters with valid SPF/DKIM via Jira Automation rules, they redirected victims through the Keitaro TDS to malicious sites. <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/26/b/spam-campaign-abuses-atlassian-jira.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Polish Energy Sector Hit by Destructive Attack</strong>: The Russian-aligned Electrum group (Sandworm) targeted over 30 decentralized energy sites (wind/solar) using wiper malware and firmware corruption. While power generation continued, remote monitoring was disabled, marking a major offensive against distributed grid edges. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/poland-energy-attack-wind-solar-infrastructure" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spain Orders VPNs to Block Piracy Sites</strong>: A Córdoba court ordered NordVPN and ProtonVPN to block 16 piracy domains. This classifies VPNs as "technological intermediaries" under EU law. Providers question the procedural validity, as they claim they were not formally notified to defend themselves. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/spain-orders-nordvpn-protonvpn-to-block-laliga-piracy-sites/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Notepad++ Hardens Update Security</strong>: Following a six-month supply-chain breach by APT31, Notepad++ v8.9.2 introduced a "double-lock" mechanism. It mandates validation of a signed XML manifest and a signed installer from GitHub, while removing vulnerable cURL options to prevent side-loading. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notepad-plus-plus-boosts-update-security-with-double-lock-mechanism/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Microsoft Teams Outage Resolved</strong>: A configuration change on Feb 17, 2026, caused an hour-long disruption for Teams users in the US and Europe. Reverting to the last healthy configuration fixed the login and chat delays, which followed similar infrastructure-linked outages in January. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-teams-outage-affects-users-in-united-states-europe/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Cellebrite Used Against Kenyan Activist</strong>: Citizen Lab confirmed that Kenyan authorities used Cellebrite technology to compromise the phone of activist Boniface Mwangi. Forensic traces of extraction apps were found on the device, exposing personal and political data following his 2025 arrest. <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/citizen-lab-kenya-cellebrite-phone-cracking-boniface-mwangi-forensic-evidence/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
