  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot leaks confidential emails</strong>: Microsoft confirmed a flaw (CW1226324) in the Copilot "work tab" where the AI incorrectly summarized emails from Sent Items and Drafts, bypassing DLP policies and sensitivity labels. The issue stemmed from a code error ignoring confidentiality protections. A server-side fix began rolling out in early February 2026, though the total number of affected enterprise organizations remains undisclosed. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-says-bug-causes-copilot-to-summarize-confidential-emails/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Grandstream GXP1600 RCE (CVE-2026-2329)</strong>: A critical buffer-overflow with a CVSS of 9.3 affects Grandstream VoIP phones. The flaw in the unauthenticated web API allows root-level remote code execution, enabling attackers to steal SIP credentials and intercept calls. Rapid7 warns of significant risks to unmonitored voice infra. A firmware patch was released on Feb 2, 2026; users should update and isolate these devices via VLANs. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/grandstream-bug-voip-security-blind-spot" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Honeywell CCTV Auth Bypass (CVE-2026-1670)</strong>: CISA issued an advisory for Honeywell CCTV models carrying a CVSS score of 9.8. An unauthenticated API endpoint allows attackers to modify the password recovery email, leading to full account takeover and live feed access. Affected models include I-HIB2PI-UL and PTZ WDR 2MP series. Honeywell recommends immediate patching and firewall isolation. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-infra-honeywell-cctvs-vulnerable-to-auth-bypass-flaw/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>CISA adds GitLab and Dell to KEV</strong>: Two high-impact flaws joined the KEV catalog. CVE-2021-22175 is a critical SSRF in GitLab allowing internal network requests. CVE-2026-22769 is a CVSS 10.0 hard-coded credential flaw in Dell RecoverPoint, currently exploited by China-linked UNC6201 for root-level persistence. Federal agencies must remediate these by March 11, 2026. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/02/18/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Rapid weaponization of SmarterMail (CVE-2026-24423)</strong>: Threat actors, including the China-linked "Warlock" group, are exploiting SmarterMail flaws for RCE and auth bypass. Attackers are abusing the "Volume Mount" feature for system persistence to stage ransomware. SmarterTools itself was reportedly breached via an unpatched VM. CISA has added these to the KEV catalog. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telegram-channels-expose-rapid-weaponization-of-smartermail-flaws/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ransomware groups abuse ISPsystem VM templates</strong>: Groups like LockBit and Qilin are using standardized VMmanager templates to hide malicious infrastructure. By using default Windows images, they generate thousands of identical nodes that blend into legitimate traffic. 95% of these malicious VMs originate from four default hostnames, primarily hosted on sanctioned providers like Stark Industries Solutions. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2026/02/ispsystem-vms-hijacked-for-silent.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Searchlight Cyber: Ransomware victims up 30%</strong>: A 2025 annual report shows a massive surge in dark web leak site listings, totaling 7,458 organizations. The ecosystem has fragmented into 124 active groups. AI is cited as a major force multiplier for malware development and social engineering, while groups are shifting toward exfiltration-only extortion to bypass improved backup defenses. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/record-number-ransomware-victims/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anime-themed Cryptojacker uses BYOVD</strong>: Trellix uncovered a campaign distributing an XMRig miner using anime-themed CLI arguments like "Re:0" and "barusu". It uses the "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" technique (CVE-2020-14979) to disable hardware prefetchers, increasing hashrates by 50%. Persistence is maintained via watchdog processes disguised as system binaries. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cryptojacking-driver-boost-monero/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenClaw "Agentic AI" security concerns</strong>: The open-source platform OpenClaw, which reached 179k GitHub stars, is being criticized as a "security nightmare." Experts found 12% of its "skills" marketplace contained malware. The platform's ability to take real-world actions combined with "vibe-coded" logic makes it highly susceptible to indirect prompt injection. Creator Peter Steinberger has since joined OpenAI to lead agent initiatives. <a href="https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/2026/02/38368-open-claw-risks" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
