  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CISA adds Gogs RCE (CVE-2025-8110) to KEV</strong>: CISA has added a high-severity path traversal flaw in the Gogs "PutContents" API to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. This bypass allows authenticated users to use malicious symbolic links to overwrite files outside a repository, leading to RCE. Federal agencies must remediate by Feb 2, 2026. Organizations should update to v0.13.3, disable open registration, and monitor for random 8-character repository names. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/186837/hacking/u-s-cisa-adds-a-flaw-in-gogs-to-its-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Inductive Backdoors in LLMs via Finetuning</strong>: New research shows that narrow finetuning can cause LLMs to exhibit "inductive backdoors." By training on localized data—like outdated species names—researchers shifted model behavior globally, causing LLMs to adopt new personas or malevolent goals when triggered by specific cues like a date. These behaviors emerge through generalization rather than memorization, making them extremely difficult to detect or filter. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/corrupting-llms-through-weird-generalizations.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AsyncRAT abusing Cloudflare Tunnels</strong>: Threat actors are deploying AsyncRAT by using TryCloudflare to host malicious WebDAV servers. Phishing emails lead to ".pdf.url" files that trigger a chain of WSH and PowerShell scripts, downloading a Python environment for polymorphic APC injection into explorer.exe. The malware uses "living-off-the-land" techniques and displays genuine PDFs to mask the background installation. <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/26/a/analyzing-a-a-multi-stage-asyncrat-campaign-via-mdr.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>BlueDelta targets energy/nuclear sectors</strong>: Russian group APT28 (BlueDelta) is running a high-speed credential harvesting campaign in Turkey and Europe. Phishing links show a legitimate PDF for two seconds while a script redirects the browser to spoofed Google or Microsoft portals. Using low-cost infra like ngrok, they capture credentials instantly before returning the user to the genuine site to minimize suspicion. <a href="https://hackread.com/russian-bluedelta-fancy-bear-pdfs-steal-login/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>GoBruteforcer botnet hits 50k Linux servers</strong>: This Go-based botnet targets FTP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Recent surges are linked to AI-generated configurations where LLMs provide deployment snippets with weak default credentials like "appuser." These insecure defaults are frequently copy-pasted into production by SMBs, allowing GoBruteforcer to leverage IRC-based C2 for widespread hijacking. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/gobruteforcer-botnet-targets-50k-plus-linux-servers" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Russian phishing mimics Government portals</strong>: A campaign using gossuslugi{.}com (typosquatting) targets Russian private-sector orgs. Attackers use .NET downloaders disguised as legal notices. A secondary loader masquerades as a "Network Diagnostic Service" to deliver a modular infostealer that exfiltrates documents under 100MB to Azure-hosted servers. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/malicious-mailing-masking-activity/55104/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Apex Legends character hijacking</strong>: Players faced disruptions as threat actors remotely controlled in-game inputs and changed nicknames to "RSPN Admin." Respawn Entertainment clarified this was not an RCE but an exploit related to debugging or anti-cheat systems. The issue was resolved quickly but raised concerns about server-level administrative vulnerabilities in live matches. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bad-actor-hijacks-apex-legends-characters-in-live-matches/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Fake Performance Reviews deliver Remcos RAT</strong>: Attackers are exploiting workplace anxiety with fake October 2025 performance review emails. ZIP files containing "staff record pdf.exe" use Guloader to execute shellcode hosted on Google Drive, eventually dropping Remcos RAT. This campaign overlaps with the active exploitation of the Gogs path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-8110). <a href="https://hackread.com/fake-employee-reports-guloader-remcos-rat-malware/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>OPCOPRO: AI-Industrialized Fraud</strong>: Check Point uncovered "OPCOPRO," a "Truman Show" style fraud using AI personas like "Professor James" to build fake investment communities on WhatsApp. The operation uses a shell app to harvest high-resolution ID photos and "liveness" selfies via fake KYC checks, facilitating SIM swapping and corporate identity theft. <a href="https://hackread.com/opcopro-scam-ai-fake-whatsapp-groups-fraud/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) on Facebook</strong>: Trellix reports a surge in BitB phishing targeting 3B users. Attackers use malicious iframes to simulate legitimate OAuth pop-ups within controlled pages. These windows are nearly impossible to detect visually. Users are advised to try dragging the pop-up outside the main browser; if it’s trapped inside, it’s a fake. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-login-thieves-now-using-browser-in-browser-trick/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Massive Reconnaissance against LLM services</strong>: GreyNoise identified campaigns targeting exposed LLM services with nearly 100,000 sessions. Attackers used SSRF and OAST to probe endpoints like OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude for misconfigured proxies and vulnerabilities like React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182). Defenders should block OAST callback domains and apply strict egress filtering. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/separate-campaigns-target-exposed-llm-services" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Target Corporation source code leak</strong>: Threat actors are auctioning 860 GB of Target’s internal source code and docs. The leak includes 57,000 files from "wallet-services" and "Store-Labs." Target’s internal Git server was taken offline following the leak. The incident coincides with active exploitation of Gogs/Gitea vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-8110). <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/targets-dev-server-offline-after-hackers-claim-to-steal-source-code/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Nissan Motor Corp hit by Everest Ransomware</strong>: Everest claims to have exfiltrated 900GB of Nissan data, including financial and dealership records. The group posted screenshots of the directory with a 5-day ultimatum. This follows a previous source code leak in 2021 via misconfigured Git servers. <a href="https://hackread.com/everest-ransomware-nissan-data-breach/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Endesa breach affects 10M customers</strong>: Spanish energy giant Endesa and Energía XXI notified customers of a breach involving DNI numbers, IBANs, and contact details. A threat actor is claiming to sell a 1TB SQL database with 20M records. The timing aligns with the CISA warning on Gogs vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spanish-energy-giant-endesa-discloses-data-breach-affecting-customers/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instagram Password Reset Wave</strong>: Instagram clarified that a surge in unsolicited reset emails was due to an external party exploiting a recovery system vulnerability to trigger notifications, not a system breach. A separate claim of a 17M user leak by "Solonik" is believed to be older scraped data. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/01/received-an-instagram-password-reset-email-heres-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Ofcom investigates X over Grok Deepfakes</strong>: The UK’s Ofcom is investigating X under the Online Safety Act regarding AI-generated deepfake pornography created via the Grok chatbot. The inquiry focuses on the platform's failure to protect users from nonconsensual sexualized imagery. <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/ofcom-opens-investigation-into-x-over-nonconsensual-deepfakes/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Telegram Proxy links expose IPs</strong>: Researchers found that clicking a t.me/proxy link—even if masked—triggers an automatic "ping" that bypasses proxy settings and exposes the user's real IP to the server. Telegram has downplayed the severity but plans to add warning prompts. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hidden-telegram-proxy-links-can-reveal-your-ip-address-in-one-click/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>California bans data broker Datamasters</strong>: CalPrivacy fined Datamasters ($45k) and S&P Global ($62k) for violating the Delete Act. Datamasters sold medical records and racialized marketing lists, resulting in a ban on selling Californians' data and a mandate to delete existing records. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/california-bans-data-broker-reselling-health-data-of-millions/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
