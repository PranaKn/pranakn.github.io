  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Critical n8n RCE Flaws (CVE-2026-25049)</strong>: Researchers identified flaws in the n8n workflow platform allowing authenticated users to bypass JavaScript sanitization and escape the sandbox. This follows the "Ni8mare" flaw (CVE-2026-21858) currently seeing massive scanning activity. Exploitation enables theft of API keys and database credentials. n8n released versions 2.5.2 and 1.123.17 to address the issues. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-n8n-flaws-disclosed-along-with-public-exploits/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>VMware ESXi Sandbox Escape (CVE-2025-22225)</strong>: CISA confirmed ransomware gangs are actively exploiting this high-severity flaw. Originally used by Chinese-speaking actors as a zero-day in 2024, it allows arbitrary kernel writes to escape a VM to the host. CISA has added it to the KEV catalog, urging immediate patching of affected ESXi environments. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-vmware-esxi-flaw-now-exploited-in-ransomware-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Orchid Security tackles "Identity Dark Matter"</strong>: Orchid introduced an Identity Control Plane to find unmanaged authentication logic and embedded credentials within application code. Using LLM-driven observability rather than simple configuration audits, the tool extracts "identity as coded" to provide real-time governance of both managed and unmanaged environments. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/orchid-security-introduces-continuous.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Google Looker "LookOut" Vulnerabilities</strong>: Tenable disclosed critical bugs in self-hosted Looker deployments. The "LookOut" chain allows for RCE and full server control, while a second flaw enables extraction of internal management databases and secrets. Managed cloud services are secured, but self-hosted admins must update to 25.12.30+ or 24.18.209+ immediately. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/02/04/google-looker-vulnerabilities-cve-2025-12743/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>LLMjacking in AWS Intrusion</strong>: Sysdig detailed a cloud breach where an attacker gained admin control in under 10 minutes. The actor used LLMs to automate reconnaissance and privilege escalation via Lambda code injection. Evidence of AI assistance included "LLMjacking" of Amazon Bedrock to generate scripts with Serbian-coded comments and hallucinations of non-existent repositories. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/aws_cloud_breakin_ai_assist/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Global SystemBC Botnet Expansion</strong>: Silent Push uncovered a SystemBC operation with over 10,000 infected IPs, including government infra in Vietnam. A novel Perl-based Linux variant with zero AV detection was identified. The botnet serves as a precursor to ransomware, acting as a SOCKS5 proxy relay to mask malicious traffic. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/global-systembc-botnet-10000/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Mustang Panda targets Diplomats</strong>: The China-linked group used fake U.S. diplomatic briefings to target government officials in Asia and Eastern Europe. Utilizing DLL search-order hijacking, they deployed DOPLUGS (a PlugX downloader) for quiet, persistent data collection during sensitive international coordination periods. <a href="https://hackread.com/chinese-mustang-panda-briefing-spy-diplomat/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ShadowSyndicate Infrastructure Growth</strong>: Group-IB linked dozens of servers through reused SSH fingerprints, identifying a cluster supporting major ransomware groups like Cl0p and Black Basta. ShadowSyndicate appears to function as an Initial Access Broker or bulletproof host, transferring servers between internal clusters to hide ownership. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/shadowsyndicate/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spear-Phishing via .scr Files</strong>: ReliaQuest identified a trend of using Windows screensaver files to bypass execution controls. These Portable Executables are being used to deploy JWrapper (an RMM tool) for persistent remote access, often disguised as business invoices or project summaries hosted on public clouds. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/attackers-use-screensavers-drop-malware-rmm-tools" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>AI Chrome Extensions Privacy Risks</strong>: A study by Incogni found that 52% of AI-powered Chrome extensions collect user data, with 42% utilizing "scripting" permissions that allow them to read and modify browser content. Tools for programming and transcription were flagged as the most invasive, potentially exposing PII for millions of users. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-chrome-extensions-data-harvesting-privacy/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Broken Nitrogen Ransomware Decryptor</strong>: Coveware identified a programming flaw in Nitrogen's VMware ESXi encryptor that makes data recovery impossible. The malware incorrectly loads a QWORD variable into memory, overwriting the first four bytes of the public key. Victims are warned that paying the ransom is entirely futile. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/nitrogen_ransomware_broken_decryptor/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coinbase Insider Breach</strong>: Coinbase confirmed a December 2025 breach where a contractor accessed the personal data of ~30 customers. While independent of other incidents, it follows screenshots posted by "Scattered Lapsus Hunters." The case underscores the risk of threat actors targeting BPO firms through social engineering. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinbase-confirms-insider-breach-linked-to-leaked-support-tool-screenshots/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Tools & Hunting</h2>
  <ul>
    
    <li><strong>Amaranth-Dragon Espionage in SE Asia</strong>: Check Point identified a Chinese-linked cluster targeting government agencies using WinRAR exploits (CVE-2025-8088). The group uses the Amaranth Loader to deploy the Havoc framework or a specialized Telegram-based RAT (TGAmaranth) for data exfiltration. <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/amaranth-dragon-weaponizes-cve-2025-8088-for-targeted-espionage/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>EnCase BYOVD EDR Killer</strong>: Huntress identified a custom "EDR killer" abusing a long-revoked EnCase kernel driver to disable 59 security tools. By exploiting a loophole in Windows driver signing, the malware gains kernel-level access to terminate processes from vendors like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/encase-byovd-edr-killer" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firefox 148 "AI Kill Switch"</strong>: Mozilla will introduce centralized AI controls, allowing users to globally disable generative AI features like chatbots and link previews. This differentiates Firefox from Edge by making AI features strictly opt-in, prioritizing user agency and privacy. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/02/firefox-is-giving-users-the-ai-off-switch" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Microsoft's AI "Sleeper Agent" Scanner</strong>: A new tool identifies backdoors in open-weight language models. It detects technical signatures like "double triangle" attention patterns and output entropy collapse, helping secure the AI supply chain against poisoned models. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/04/detecting-backdoored-language-models-at-scale/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Tools </h2>
    <li><strong>Native Sysmon in Windows 11</strong>: Microsoft has integrated Sysmon functionality natively into Windows 11 Insider builds. This allows enterprise admins to enable granular system monitoring (process creation, clipboard changes) via optional features without manual installation, simplifying threat hunting deployments. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-native-windows-11-sysmon-security-monitoring/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
