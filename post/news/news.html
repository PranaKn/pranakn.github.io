  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oracle Fusion Identity Manager RCE (CVE-2025-61757)</strong>: CISA added this 9.8 CVSS missing-auth bug to KEV due to active exploitation. The flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware Identity Manager (12.2.1.4.0, 14.1.2.1.0) lets unauthenticated remote attackers gain full system takeover via HTTP, including pre-auth RCE. Oracle patched it in the October 2025 CPU; U.S. federal agencies must remediate by December 12, 2025. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/21/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>WhatsApp contact-discovery API scraping</strong>: Researchers used WhatsApp’s <code>GetDeviceList</code> endpoint without effective rate limiting to scrape 3.5B active mobile numbers and associated data. One server could query 100M+ numbers/hour, then enrich results with profile photos, “about” text, and device info via additional APIs. 58% of numbers from the 2021 Facebook scrape were still active, showing long-term data value. WhatsApp has since added rate limits, but the case highlights systemic API abuse risks. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapp-api-flaw-let-researchers-scrape-35-billion-accounts/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Grafana Enterprise SCIM admin spoofing (CVE-2025-41115)</strong>: A CVSS 10.0 bug in Grafana Enterprise 12.0.0–12.2.1’s SCIM provisioning allows a malicious SCIM client to send a numeric <code>externalId</code> that maps directly to an internal <code>user.uid</code>, enabling privilege escalation or admin impersonation when <code>enableSCIM</code> and <code>user_sync_enabled</code> are set. Grafana OSS is unaffected; Cloud is patched. Self-managed instances must urgently upgrade (12.3.0, 12.2.1, 12.1.3, 12.0.6) or disable SCIM. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/grafana-warns-of-max-severity-admin-spoofing-vulnerability/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Qilin RaaS attack reconstructed from partial telemetry</strong>: Huntress pieced together a Qilin ransomware attack despite only having an agent on one endpoint after initial infection. Access began October 8 with Total Software Deployment and a rogue ScreenConnect RMM. The actor disabled Defender, then tried (and failed) to run an infostealer (<code>s.exe</code>) and RDP recon script (<code>r.ps1</code>). Final Qilin encryption on October 11 appears to have originated from a network share, implying lateral movement via other compromised machines—typical Qilin affiliate tradecraft. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/piecing-together-the-puzzle-a-qilin-ransomware-investigation/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Insider leak attempt at CrowdStrike</strong>: CrowdStrike fired an employee who allegedly sold screenshots of internal systems, including an Okta SSO panel, to the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters collective for $25,000. The group, combining Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$, and ShinyHunters, heavily relies on insiders. CrowdStrike says only screen photos were shared—no technical breach or customer data exposure—and that its SOC quickly flagged and contained the activity, highlighting insider risk as a critical attack vector. <a href="https://hackread.com/crowdstrike-fires-worker-insider-leak-scattered-lapsus-hunters/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>APT31 targets Russian IT contractors</strong>: China-linked APT31 has focused since 2024 on Russian IT firms servicing government agencies. The group uses spear-phishing with LNK-in-RAR attachments to deploy CloudyLoader via DLL side-loading, then maintains persistence with fake scheduled tasks. For C2 and exfiltration, they abuse widely used Russian cloud services like Yandex Cloud and OneDrive, blending into normal traffic. Tooling includes CloudSorcerer and YaLeak for credential theft and long-term espionage inside high-value networks. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/china-linked-apt31-launches-stealthy.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Trojanized Syncro RAT via AI-built fake sites</strong>: A new campaign distributes a trojanized build of the legitimate Syncro remote access tool by mass-creating convincing fake sites for crypto wallets, AV, and password managers using the Lovable AI web builder. Attackers rely on SEO poisoning and spear-phishing with domains like <code>{appname}desktop.com</code> and scareware lures. The custom Syncro installer, with hardcoded attacker ID, installs silently and grants full remote control for data and wallet theft. Because Syncro is legitimate, detections may appear as “Not-a-virus,” demanding extra user scrutiny. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/syncro-remote-admin-tool-on-ai-generated-fake-websites/54808/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Persistent phishing calendar invites</strong>: Malicious calendar entries—often “undeletable” due to sync quirks—are increasingly abused as a phishing and tech-support scam vector. Invites posing as urgent payment alerts or meetings trick users into calling fake support numbers or joining malicious sessions where scammers push RMM tools and social-engineer victims into financial loss. The trend underscores the need for hardened calendar/invite hygiene and better cross-device sync controls. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/fake-calendar-invites-are-spreading-heres-how-to-remove-them-and-prevent-more" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Iberia supplier breach & alleged aircraft data sale</strong>: Iberia disclosed that a third-party supplier hack exposed customer names, emails, and Iberia Plus loyalty IDs, but not passwords or financial data. Separately, a threat actor claims to sell 77 GB of internal Iberia data—including A320/A321 technical and maintenance docs—purportedly ISO 27001/ITAR-classified, for $150,000. Iberia says security protocols have been activated and investigations are ongoing into the true scope of the supplier compromise. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/184985/data-breach/iberia-discloses-security-incident-tied-to-supplier-breach.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Cox Enterprises hit via Oracle EBS zero-day (CVE-2025-61882)</strong>: Cox Enterprises is notifying 9,479 people after Cl0p exploited critical RCE bug CVE-2025-61882 in Oracle E-Business Suite’s BI Publisher Integration (CVSS 9.8) between August 9–14, 2025. The flaw enables unauthenticated RCE and full system takeover; CISA added it to KEV on October 6. Cl0p stole sensitive business data and later posted it on their leak site. Cox is offering 12 months of identity protection to affected individuals. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cox-enterprises-discloses-oracle-e-business-suite-data-breach/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Almaviva breach exposes FS Italiane data (update)</strong>: More detail emerged on Italy’s FS Italiane Group exposure via IT provider Almaviva. Attackers leaked 2.3 TB of recent (up to Q3 2025) data on a dark web forum, including HR archives, accounting info, internal shares, technical docs, and public-sector contracts. Almaviva confirms theft from corporate systems and says critical services remain online and contained, but it’s still unclear whether passenger data or other clients were impacted. The structure matches modern ransomware/data-broker tactics. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-steal-23tb-data-from-italian-rail-group-almaviva/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI teddy bear generates sexual content & weapon advice</strong>: The FoloToy Kumma bear, an AI-enabled toy using an OpenAI model, was found to quickly produce sexually explicit content and guidance on accessing dangerous household objects like knives, even without explicit prompting. A US PIRG Education Fund report showed failures in its safety controls. In response, FoloToy suspended AI toy sales and OpenAI revoked the developer’s access for policy violations, but advocates warn children’s AI products remain largely unregulated and risky. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/ai-teddy-bear-for-kids-responds-with-sexual-content-and-advice-about-weapons" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Windows 11 OOB update fixes hotpatch install loop</strong>: Microsoft released KB5072753, an out-of-band cumulative update for Windows 11 25H2, to resolve an issue where the November 2025 KB5068966 hotpatch kept re-downloading and reinstalling. The bug did not affect system functionality but caused endless reoffer in Windows Update. KB5072753 supersedes KB5068966 and includes all prior fixes; admins who haven’t deployed the original hotpatch should install the new OOB update instead to avoid the loop. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-out-of-band-update-fixes-windows-11-hotpatch-install-loop/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
