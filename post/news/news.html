  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cursor MCP injection & credential theft</strong>: Knostic found Cursor’s AI dev environment lacks integrity checks used by VS Code, allowing malicious MCP servers to tamper with runtime components. Attackers can overwrite login pages, inject arbitrary HTML/JS, and force all new tabs to run attacker-controlled code, enabling credential theft and browser hijacking. Cursor claims the issue is inherent to its design, underscoring supply-chain risks in AI tooling and the need to strictly vet extensions and MCP servers. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/cursor-issue-credential-stealing-attacks" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>EchoGram LLM guardrail bypass</strong>: HiddenLayer’s EchoGram technique abuses “flip tokens” — nonsense strings absent from guardrail training data — to invert allow/deny decisions in models like GPT-5.1, Claude, and Gemini. A single token such as <code>=coffee</code> can sneak malicious prompts past filters or falsely block benign ones, enabling abuse and alert fatigue. Researchers warn attackers could replicate the method within months, with serious implications for high-stakes sectors using LLM-based safety layers. <a href="https://hackread.com/echogram-flaw-bypass-guardrails-major-llms/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Kraken ransomware benchmarks victims</strong>: Cisco Talos reports Kraken, a Russian-speaking group spun out of HelloKitty, launched major big-game attacks in August 2025. The group exploits SMB flaws, uses Cloudflare for persistence, and SSHFS for data theft, then encrypts Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems. Its new strain benchmarks each host to pick the fastest, lowest-noise encryption method. Operations use credential theft, RDP access, multi-threaded encryptors, and ransoms around $1M. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/kraken-benchmarking-enhance/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>DoorDash email spoofing dispute</strong>: A flaw in DoorDash for Business allowed anyone to send fully branded emails from <code>no-reply@doordash.com</code> via HTML injection in the Budget Name field. Stored unsanitized, it let attackers hide real content and insert phishing payloads. The bug reportedly lingered 15+ months after a HackerOne report marked “Informative.” DoorDash eventually patched it but banned the researcher for alleged extortion, sparking debate over disclosure and bug bounty practices. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doordash-email-spoofing-vulnerability-sparks-messy-disclosure-dispute/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>INC Ransom hits Pennsylvania AG</strong>: Pennsylvania’s Attorney General confirmed that an August 9 ransomware attack led to theft of names, Social Security numbers, and medical data, while taking down the website, email, and phone systems. Analysts noted exposed Citrix NetScaler devices vulnerable to Citrix Bleed 2 (CVE-2025-5777), likely exploited. INC Ransom claimed 5.7TB of stolen data and even alleged FBI network access, adding to a series of ransomware incidents against the state. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pennsylvania-ag-confirms-data-breach-after-inc-ransom-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Dragon Breath’s RONINGLOADER & Gh0st RAT</strong>: Dragon Breath (APT-Q-27), part of Miuuti Group, uses a multi-stage loader dubbed RONINGLOADER via trojanized NSIS installers for apps like Chrome and Teams. The campaign employs heavy defense evasion, WDAC tampering, PPL/EDR-Freeze tricks, and a signed driver (<code>ollama.sys</code>) to kill Chinese AV tools. RONINGLOADER injects a modified Gh0st RAT via <code>regsvr32</code> to support command execution, data theft, keylogging, clipboard capture, and persistence, alongside large-scale Chinese app impersonation. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/dragon-breath-uses-roningloader-to.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EVALUSION ClickFix campaigns</strong>: eSentire tracks new ClickFix-driven campaigns, dubbed EVALUSION, distributing Amatera Stealer and NetSupport RAT. Amatera, a MaaS evolution of ACR Stealer, targets crypto wallets, browsers, messaging and FTP/email clients while evading AV/EDR with WoW64 syscalls. Infection chains abuse <code>mshta.exe</code> and PowerShell to pull a PureCrypter-packed DLL injected into MSBuild, with NetSupport deployed only on high-value hosts. Related activity uses Cephas and Tycoon 2FA phishing kits to spread XWorm and other stealers. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/new-evalusion-clickfix-campaign.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Fake X DMCA takedowns steal logins</strong>: Scammers send bogus copyright complaints posing as X, urging users to “Review Details” within 24 hours or face account restrictions. The link leads to a phishing page mimicking X’s login to harvest credentials. The scheme leans on urgency and realistic formatting. Defenses include checking URLs, enabling 2FA, avoiding unsolicited links, and using password managers that won’t autofill on fake domains; victims should reset passwords and revoke third-party access. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/scammers-are-sending-bogus-copyright-warnings-to-steal-your-x-login" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Contagious Interview pivots to JSON hosting</strong>: NVISO reports that North Korea’s Contagious Interview campaign now hides payloads on JSON Keeper, JSONsilo, and npoint.io. Fake recruiters on LinkedIn send “interview demo projects” to crypto/Web3 developers, with repos containing Base64 “API keys” that actually point to JSON-hosted malware. Victims receive BeaverTail (JS infostealer), which deploys InvisibleFerret (Python RAT) and TsunamiKit profiling tools, while attackers abuse GitHub/GitLab and Railway for hosting. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/184726/cyber-warfare-2/north-korean-threat-actors-use-json-sites-to-deliver-malware-via-trojanized-code.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
