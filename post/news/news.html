     <h2>📅 15/12/25</h2>

     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple patches two WebKit zero-days (CVE-2025-43529, CVE-2025-14174)</strong>: Apple released emergency updates for two WebKit zero-day flaws exploited in "extremely sophisticated" targeted attacks against iPhone 11 and later devices. CVE-2025-43529 is a use-after-free RCE, and CVE-2025-14174 is a memory corruption flaw. The latter, an out-of-bounds memory access in ANGLE, has been added to the CISA KEV Catalog, marking it as an urgent patching priority due to active, targeted exploitation consistent with spyware campaigns. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-fixes-two-zero-day-flaws-exploited-in-sophisticated-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>New Windows RasMan DoS zero-day re-enables EoP attack chain</strong>: 0patch researchers discovered a new, unpatched Windows zero-day in the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service that causes a Denial-of-Service (DoS) crash. Crucially, this DoS flaw can be chained with the previously patched RasMan privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2025-59230), which is listed in the CISA KEV Catalog. Since the EoP exploit requires the RasMan service to be stopped, this new zero-day re-enables the full attack path. 0patch is offering a free, unofficial micropatch to mitigate the risk. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/12/microsoft_windows_rasman_dos_0day/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>SEO poisoning leverages ChatGPT/Grok to spread AMOS Stealer</strong>: A new campaign is exploiting the trusted status of AI conversational tools like ChatGPT and Grok. Attackers use SEO poisoning and sponsored search results to surface fake, but credible, AI-generated conversations on official domains. These pages trick macOS users into copying and pasting a malicious, base64-encoded Terminal command that executes a bash script, bypassing Gatekeeper, and silently deploying the pervasive **Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS)** to harvest Keychain passwords, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallets. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/google-ads-funnel-mac-users-to-poisoned-ai-chats-that-spread-the-amos-infostealer" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>PayPal Subscriptions feature abused for high-value phishing scam</strong>: Scammers are exploiting PayPal's legitimate "Subscriptions" feature to send authentic-looking emails from the official **service@paypal.com** address with fake high-value purchase notifications. By embedding fraudulent messages and a cancellation phone number into the Customer service URL field of a genuine "automatic payment no longer active" email, the emails bypass spam filters. The scam tricks victims into calling the provided number, leading to potential fraud or malware installation. PayPal is working to mitigate the method. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-paypal-subscriptions-abused-to-send-fake-purchase-emails/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>CyberVolk's VolkLocker RaaS fails due to hardcoded key flaw</strong>: The pro-Russia hacktivist group CyberVolk launched **VolkLocker**, a new Golang-based cross-platform Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) targeting Windows and Linux/VMware ESXi. However, researchers found a critical implementation flaw: the ransomware uses a **hardcoded master key** for all file encryption and saves this key in plaintext to a file named <code>system_backup.key</code> in the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory, potentially allowing victims to recover their data. The RaaS is considered immature, despite having a destructive timer function. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cybervolks-ransomware-debut-stumbles-on-cryptography-weakness/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Fake GitHub OSINT tools distribute PyStoreRAT</strong>: A sophisticated, multi-stage campaign is distributing the novel **PyStoreRAT** (Remote Access Trojan) by abusing GitHub. Threat actors create popular, fake repositories masquerading as OSINT or security utilities, then insert a malicious Python/JavaScript loader via subtle "maintenance" commits. The loader executes a remote HTA file using <code>mshta.exe</code>, which deploys the modular PyStoreRAT. The RAT evades EDRs, establishes persistence, searches for cryptocurrency wallets, and delivers follow-on payloads like the Rhadamanthys info-stealer. <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2025/12/fake-github-osint-tools-spread.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Agent Tesla hidden in pirated movie subtitle files (.srt)</strong>: A highly stealthy campaign is distributing the persistent info-stealer **Agent Tesla** by concealing malicious PowerShell scripts within subtitle files of pirated movie torrents. The infection chain starts with a shortcut file (.lnk) that, when executed, triggers a command to extract and run a script hidden inside the .srt file. This multi-stage process ultimately bypasses detection and installs the Agent Tesla payload directly into memory, which specializes in stealing credentials from browsers, email, FTP, and VPN clients. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-one-battle-after-another-torrent-hides-malware-in-subtitles/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Four new PhaaS kits use AI, stealth, and MitB for credential theft</strong>: The industrialization of cybercrime is evidenced by four new Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) kits. **BlackForce** uses Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) to bypass MFA/OTPs. **GhostFrame** embeds malicious pages in constantly-changing iframes for stealth. **Spiderman** is a full-stack framework targeting dozens of European banks. **InboxPrime AI** leverages generative AI to automate mass-mailing campaigns, creating highly convincing, unique emails to bypass traditional filters. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/new-advanced-phishing-kits-use-ai-and.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Hamas-affiliated Wirte group upgrades toolkit for cyber espionage</strong>: The Hamas-affiliated threat group Wirte (Ashen Lepus) has expanded its persistent cyber espionage, now targeting government and diplomatic entities in nations like Oman and Morocco. The group upgraded its toolkit with the new **AshTag** malware suite, which features enhanced stealth and modularity. The infection chain uses phishing lures and exploits **DLL side-loading**, with the multi-stage loader evading detection by embedding secondary payloads within outwardly benign C2 HTML tags, including commented-out sections. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/hamas-hackers-middle-eastern-diplomats" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Offensive AI is accelerating cyberattacks; NDR systems are critical</strong>: Adversarial AI-based attacks are achieving unprecedented speed and scale in orchestrating campaigns, automating reconnaissance and lateral movement, which can overwhelm manual security methods. This shift necessitates a Zero Trust model and highlights the critical role of **Network Detection and Response (NDR)** systems. NDR uses real-time behavioral analytics and machine learning on network traffic to identify subtle anomalies, detect fast-moving polymorphic attacks, and reveal lateral threat movement that traditional tools miss. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ai-is-accelerating-cyberattacks-is-your-network-prepared/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Fake Microsoft Teams/Google Meet downloads spread Oyster Backdoor</strong>: A malvertising and SEO poisoning campaign is targeting users, particularly in the financial sector, by disguising malware as legitimate office tools like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. Attackers direct victims to malicious download sites that deliver the **Oyster backdoor** (aka Broomstick/CleanUpLoader). Oyster is a preferred initial access tool for human-operated ransomware groups, including **Rhysida** and **Vanilla Tempest**, who leverage it to establish a foothold and conduct reconnaissance before deploying ransomware payloads. <a href="https://hackread.com/fake-microsoft-teams-google-meet-download-oyster-backdoor/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Job lure campaign uses DLL side-loading to spread PureRAT</strong>: A new email campaign is targeting job seekers and HR professionals with job lure attachments (e.g., <code>Overview_of_Work_Expectations.zip</code>) to spread the **PureRAT** (ResolverRAT) Remote Access Trojan. The attack employs a sophisticated chain that begins with **DLL side-loading**, abusing a renamed Foxit PDF Reader executable to load a malicious DLL. The infection then extracts a hidden, bundled Python environment and runs an encoded Python script to launch the full-featured, modular PureRAT payload. <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/l/valleyrat-campaign.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Unsecured 16TB MongoDB exposes 4.3 billion professional records</strong>: An enormous, unsecured 16TB MongoDB database was discovered, exposing approximately 4.3 billion professional records, with nearly two billion containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like names, emails, phone numbers, and job roles, scraped from sources like LinkedIn. This massive, structured dataset is highly dangerous as it enables large-scale, highly personalized **AI-driven social engineering attacks**, such as phishing and CEO fraud. The database was secured two days after the owner was notified. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/185661/data-breach/experts-found-an-unsecured-16tb-database-containing-4-3b-professional-records.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>📚 Others</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile network operators facing $19B annual security cost due to regulatory friction</strong>: Mobile network operators are spending up to $19 billion annually on security due to escalating attack volumes and significant friction from complex, uneven regulatory demands across multiple nations. The GSMA argues that this lack of alignment and focus on input-driven compliance, rather than risk outcomes, diverts resources from effective threat detection and response. The organization advocates for coherent, risk-based policies aligned with global standards like ISO 27001. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/12/12/gsma-mobile-network-security-pressures-report/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
