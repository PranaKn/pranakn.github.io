  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>eScan Antivirus supply chain attack</strong>: Cybersecurity firm Morphisec reports that eScan users suffered a supply chain attack after hackers compromised a regional update server. Malicious updates distributed "Reload.exe," which disabled automatic updates via HOSTS file modification and established persistence. Because the malware severs connections to legitimate infrastructure, automated remediation is impossible; users must manually obtain a specialized utility from eScan support. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/escan-antivirus-delivers-malware-in-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Instagram private profile data leak</strong>: Researcher Jatin Banga exposed a server-side authorization vulnerability in Instagram that leaked private account content to unauthenticated visitors. By analyzing HTML on mobile user-agents, the "polaris_timeline_connection" object was found to contain encoded CDN links to private photos and captions. Meta quietly patched the flaw shortly after disclosure. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-reveals-evidence-of-private-instagram-profiles-leaking-photos/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Ivanti EPMM critical zero-days (CVE-2026-1281/1340)</strong>: Ivanti released emergency updates for two critical flaws (CVSS 9.8) in Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing unauthenticated RCE via specialized HTTP GET requests. CISA has added CVE-2026-1281 to its KEV catalog, mandating remediation by February 1, 2026. Attackers are already deploying web shells for persistence. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/two-ivanti-epmm-zero-day-rce-flaws.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pulsar RAT interactive malware</strong>: A new campaign utilizes the Pulsar RAT and Stealerv37 to facilitate real-time interactions with victims. Executed via in-memory PowerShell, the malware allows attackers to engage victims through a live chat window while harvesting credentials and crypto wallets. It exfiltrates data via Discord and Telegram and actively disables security prompts and Task Manager. <a href="https://hackread.com/windows-malware-pulsar-rat-live-chats-steal-data/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ShinyHunters vishing-fueled SaaS theft</strong>: Mandiant reports that ShinyHunters (and clusters UNC6661/6671) are executing data-theft attacks using sophisticated vishing. Attackers impersonate IT helpdesks to capture SSO credentials and MFA codes, allowing them to enroll their own devices and exfiltrate data from Salesforce, SharePoint, and Google Workspace. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mandiant-details-how-shinyhunters-abuse-sso-to-steal-cloud-data/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>RedKitten targets NGOs with AI-generated malware</strong>: Iranian state-sponsored actor RedKitten is using AI-generated malware to target human rights groups. The campaign uses macro-laced Excel files to deploy the SloppyMIO backdoor, which leverages GitHub and Google Drive for configuration. C2 is managed via the Telegram Bot API alongside fake WhatsApp and Gmail phishing pages. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/iran-linked-redkitten-cyber-campaign.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Static Tundra attacks Polish energy infrastructure</strong>: Russian-linked group Static Tundra (FSB Center 16) launched destructive attacks against Poland’s energy grid. Using vulnerable Fortinet devices, they deployed "DynoWiper" and the LLM-developed "LazyWiper" malware. While communications were disrupted, electricity production remained stable. The group targeted OT and SCADA documentation for long-term sabotage. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/poland-attributes-december-cyber.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Labyrinth Chollima fragmentation</strong>: CrowdStrike has reclassified North Korean threat group Labyrinth Chollima into three entities: Golden Chollima (crypto theft/recruitment fraud), Pressure Chollima (high-value opportunistic heists via "MataNet"), and Labyrinth Chollima (industrial/defense espionage). This reflects a maturing, specialized bureaucratic structure within the DPRK cyber ecosystem. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/labyrinth-chollima-dprk-three/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>UAT-8099 targets IIS servers in SE Asia</strong>: China-linked actor UAT-8099 is targeting IIS servers in Thailand and Vietnam for black-hat SEO fraud. Using variants like BadIIS IISHijack, the actor intercepts HTTP requests to inject malicious JS or redirect search crawlers to gambling sites, maintaining persistence via hidden admin accounts. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/china-linked-uat-8099-targets-iis.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automated MongoDB extortion</strong>: Flare reveals a campaign targeting misconfigured MongoDB instances, compromising roughly 1,400 servers. Attackers wipe database contents and demand a 0.005 BTC ransom for restoration. Approximately 95,000 instances remain exposed or running outdated, vulnerable software. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exposed-mongodb-instances-still-targeted-in-data-extortion-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Cloud storage payment phishing</strong>: A global campaign is using Google Cloud Storage links to bypass filters, claiming immediate data deletion due to payment failures. Victims are redirected to fake "loyalty" discount pages and eventually funneled into credit card harvesting forms or affiliate marketing scams. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloud-storage-payment-scam-floods-inboxes-with-fake-renewals/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Arsink Android RAT active in 143 countries</strong>: Zimperium zLabs uncovered "Arsink," a sophisticated RAT masquerading as "Pro" or "Mod" versions of apps like TikTok and WhatsApp. With 45,000 compromises, the malware allows audio/video recording and SMS harvesting, utilizing Firebase and Google Drive for C2. <a href="https://hackread.com/arsink-spyware-whatsapp-youtube-instagram-tiktok/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
    
    <li><strong>Illicit Crypto flows surge</strong>: Illicit cryptocurrency flows hit a record $158 billion in 2025, driven largely by sanctions-linked activity (Russia, Iran, Venezuela). While ransomware incidents hit record highs, actual payment rates slowed as victims increasingly refused to pay. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crypto-wallets-received-a-record-158-billion-in-illicit-funds-last-year/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
