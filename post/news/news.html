  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Office Zero-Day (CVE-2026-21509)</strong>: Microsoft issued emergency updates for a high-severity security feature bypass. The flaw involves improper handling of untrusted inputs, allowing attackers to bypass OLE mitigations via malicious files. While Microsoft 365 and Office 2021/2024 received service-side protection, Office 2016/2019 users must apply manual registry modifications to disable vulnerable COM/OLE controls. Exploitation has been detected in the wild. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-office-zero-day-vulnerability/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>CISA Adds Three Exploited Flaws to KEV</strong>: CISA expanded its catalog to include CVE-2018-14634 (Linux kernel privilege escalation), CVE-2025-52691 (SmarterMail arbitrary file upload), and CVE-2026-23760 (SmarterMail admin password reset bypass). The SmarterMail flaws allow unauthenticated RCE or full account takeover. Users are urged to patch Linux kernels and upgrade SmarterMail to Build 9511 or later. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>800,000 Telnet Servers Exposed (CVE-2026-24061)</strong>: A critical 11-year-old authentication bypass in the GNU InetUtils telnetd server allows remote root access. By passing a crafted "-f root" value during negotiation, attackers skip password verification. GreyNoise confirmed active exploitation immediately following the patch. Admins should upgrade to version 2.8 or disable Telnet. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nearly-800-000-telnet-servers-exposed-to-remote-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>"PackageGate" Bypasses JS Security</strong>: Researchers identified flaws in npm, pnpm, Bun, and vlt that bypass <code>--ignore-scripts</code> protections. By using Git-based dependencies and malicious .npmrc files, attackers can execute arbitrary code during installation. While most managers issued patches, npm maintains the behavior is intentional, leaving developers at risk of supply-chain RCE. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>'Stanley' MaaS Targets Chrome Extensions</strong>: A new malware-as-a-service lets attackers deploy malicious extensions that bypass Google’s Web Store review. Using full-screen iframes, the extensions overlay phishing content while maintaining a legitimate URL in the address bar. The service includes geographic targeting and C2 tracking for a fee of $2,000–$6,000. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-malware-service-guarantees-phishing-extensions-on-chrome-web-store/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>ShinyHunters Targets Okta SSO</strong>: A large-scale vishing campaign has targeted over 100 high-value organizations, including Atlassian and Canva. Attackers use social engineering to compromise credentials and enroll their own devices into MFA. Breaches of Crunchbase and Betterment have been claimed, resulting in millions of leaked records. Experts recommend FIDO2 security keys to combat these techniques. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/shinyhunters_okta_sso_campaign/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>KONNI Group Adopts AI for Malware</strong>: The North Korea-linked KONNI group is targeting blockchain developers with AI-generated PowerShell backdoors. The malware features modular code and verbose documentation typical of AI outputs. The campaign uses Discord-hosted ZIPs and LNK files to deploy RMM tools, signaling a shift toward AI-assisted development to increase operational speed. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/187317/apt/north-korea-linked-konni-uses-ai-to-build-stealthy-malware-tooling.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ClickFix Abuses Windows App-V Scripts</strong>: A new campaign uses fake CAPTCHAs to trick users into running commands that leverage <code>SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs</code>, a signed Windows LOLBIN. This method proxies PowerShell execution to deliver the Amatera infostealer. The chain uses Google Calendar for C2 configuration and steganography to hide its final payload. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-clickfix-attacks-abuse-windows-app-v-scripts-to-push-malware/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>MS Teams Guest Invites for Vishing</strong>: Attackers are leveraging legitimate Microsoft Teams group invitations, like "Subscription Auto-Pay Notice," to bypass email filters. Instead of links, the alerts contain fraudulent support numbers to initiate voice-based social engineering. Over 6,000 users have been targeted, primarily in the manufacturing and tech sectors. <a href="https://hackread.com/fake-microsoft-teams-billing-phishing-alerts-emails/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cloudflare BGP Route Leak</strong>: Cloudflare detailed a 25-minute incident on January 22 that caused 12 Gbps of data loss for IPv6 traffic. The leak resulted from a misconfigured routing policy in Miami that accidentally exported internal iBGP routes to external providers. Cloudflare is now implementing stricter export safeguards and accelerating RPKI ASPA adoption. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-misconfiguration-behind-recent-bgp-route-leak/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
