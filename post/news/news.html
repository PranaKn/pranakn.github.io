    <p>🧱 <b>CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog</b><br>
    CISA has added CVE-2025-31161, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 to 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 to 11.3.0, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate users, including administrators, potentially leading to full system compromise. Exploitation has been observed in the wild since March 2025. CrushFTP has released patches; users should upgrade to versions 10.8.4 or 11.3.1 or later immediately. If immediate patching isn't possible, enabling the DMZ proxy can serve as a temporary mitigation.<br>

    <p>📱 <b>Google's April 2025 Android Update Patches 62 Vulnerabilities, Including Two Zero-Days</b><br>
    Google's April 2025 Android update addresses 62 vulnerabilities, including two zero-days exploited in targeted attacks. One, CVE-2024-53197, is a high-severity privilege escalation flaw in the Linux kernel's USB-audio driver, reportedly used by Serbian authorities via Cellebrite's zero-day exploit chain to unlock Android devices. This chain also included zero-days CVE-2024-53104 and CVE-2024-50302. The second zero-day, CVE-2024-53150, involves an Android kernel information disclosure bug. Amnesty International uncovered the exploit in 2024. Fixes were shared with OEMs in January. Google Pixel devices received updates immediately; others may face delays. This follows a similar NoviSpy spyware exploit fixed in November 2024.<br>

    <p>🛠️ <b>Malicious VSCode Extensions Infect Windows with Cryptominers</b><br>
    Researchers have uncovered nine malicious VSCode extensions on Microsoft's Marketplace that infect users with the XMRig cryptominer to mine Ethereum and Monero. Disguised as legitimate tools like "Discord Rich Presence" and "Solidity Compiler," these extensions—published April 4, 2025—have over 300,000 installs, likely inflated to appear credible. Upon installation, they execute a PowerShell script that disables security features, establishes persistence, and downloads XMRig from a remote server. The malware also mimics system binaries for privilege escalation. Despite reports to Microsoft, the extensions remain online. Users are urged to uninstall them and remove associated malware components immediately.<br>

    <p>🎭 <b>Everest Ransomware Gang's Dark Web Leak Site Hacked and Defaced</b><br>
    The Everest ransomware gang's dark web leak site was hacked over the weekend by an unknown attacker who defaced it with a message mocking cybercrime. The site, now offline, showed "Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague" before disappearing entirely. Experts suspect a WordPress vulnerability may have enabled the breach. Everest, active since 2020, has targeted over 230 victims using double-extortion tactics and has also acted as an initial access broker. Its recent victims include cannabis brand STIIIZY and several U.S. healthcare organizations, prompting warnings from the Department of Health and Human Services.<br>

    <p>🐱 <b>ToddyCat APT Exploits ESET Vulnerability to Load Silent Malware</b><br>
    The Chinese-linked APT group ToddyCat is exploiting CVE-2024-11859, a DLL search order hijacking flaw in ESET antivirus software, to execute stealthy malware dubbed TCESB. Discovered by Kaspersky, the malicious `version.dll` mimics the legitimate Windows library to silently run in the background, bypassing detection and disabling security alerts at the kernel level. Despite ESET patching the flaw in January 2025, ToddyCat continues targeting systems using unpatched versions. The group also abuses CVE-2021-36276 in a Dell driver to escalate privileges. Experts recommend monitoring vulnerable driver installs and suspicious kernel debug activity to detect and prevent such sophisticated threats.<br>

    <p>🎨 <b>Tampered BGInfo.exe Used to Deploy Vidar Stealer Malware</b><br>
    A tampered version of Sysinternals' BGInfo.exe has been weaponized to deploy the Vidar Stealer malware. Though it mirrors the legitimate file in metadata and versioning (4.33), the malicious version differs in size (2.1 MiB vs. 10.2 MiB) and hash, and fails to update the desktop wallpaper—a key BGInfo function. The malware modifies BGInfo’s heap initialization to hijack execution, allocating memory for further stages via `VirtualAlloc`, ultimately loading and running Vidar. The stealer’s payload, extracted as <code>vidardump.bin</code>, targets credentials, wallets, and session tokens from apps like FileZilla, Telegram, and Brave, and hijacks thread execution via <code>RtlUserThreadStart</code>.<br>
