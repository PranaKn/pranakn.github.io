     <h2>📅 26/11/25</h2>

     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Firefox Wasm Engine Flaw Exposed 180M Users (CVE-2025-13016)</strong>: A high-severity stack buffer overflow in the **Firefox WebAssembly (Wasm) engine** was silently exposed for six months, affecting over 180 million users. The flaw, a mistake in pointer arithmetic within the Garbage Collection mechanism, could lead to **arbitrary code execution** by forcing memory corruption on a malicious webpage. Mozilla patched the issue on November 11, 2025, in versions Firefox 145 and Firefox ESR 140.5. <a href="https://hackread.com/update-firefox-patch-cve-2025-13016-vulnerability/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
          <li><strong>IoT Privacy Risk in Aircraft Cabins</strong>: A study reveals that the primary privacy risk in **aircraft cabin IoT devices** occurs after data is received by authorized devices. The publish-subscribe network architecture allows devices to view entire messages, often including raw sensor readings that disclose **private passenger body movements** or proprietary vendor data. Researchers advocate for on-device protection methods like differential privacy or secret sharing, as the network structure, not the privacy logic, causes the exposure. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/11/25/aircraft-cabin-iot-privacy-exposure/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>"HashJack" Indirect Prompt Injection Targets AI Browser Assistants</strong>: The novel **HashJack attack** exploits the URL fragment (the section after a '#') to hide malicious instructions, targeting AI browser assistants like Copilot and Gemini. Since the fragment is never sent to the server, this technique **weaponizes legitimate websites** to trick the AI, bypassing traditional network and server-side defenses to command harmful actions like data exfiltration. Microsoft and Perplexity have applied fixes. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/25/hashjack_attack_ai_browser_hashtag/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>FlexibleFerret Operators Deploy Multi-Stage macOS Malware</strong>: Jamf Threat Labs attributed a sophisticated macOS campaign to **FlexibleFerret**, using a multi-stage infection chain for persistence and credential theft. The malware uses a script that adapts based on the chip (arm64/Intel), uses a LaunchAgent for persistence, and launches a **decoy application** that mimics legitimate Chrome prompts to steal credentials, exfiltrating them to Dropbox. The final stage deploys the **CDrivers Go-based backdoor** for system control and automated credential theft. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/flexibleferret-malware-macos-go/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
          <li><strong>ToddyCat APT Evolves to Steal Corporate Email Data</strong>: The **ToddyCat APT** group is using new TTPs to steal corporate email data. They deploy a PowerShell variant of their **TomBerBil malware** on domain controllers to remotely steal browser data and credentials, which are then decrypted using captured DPAPI keys. A custom C++ tool, **TCSectorCopy**, bypasses restrictions to read Outlook OST files sector-by-sector, while other tools harvest Microsoft 365 OAuth 2.0 access tokens for persistent external mail access. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/toddycats-new-hacking-tools-steal.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>JackFix Campaign Uses Fake Windows Update Lure</strong>: The **JackFix campaign** is an evolution of the ClickFix social engineering attack, using fake adult websites as a lure to hijack the victim's browser screen and display a convincing, full-screen **"critical" Windows security update prompt**. This tricks the user into manually executing malicious commands that launch an MSHTA payload, fetching an obfuscated PowerShell script. The script gains admin privileges, sets Windows Defender exclusions, and deploys up to eight different malware payloads, including infostealers like Rhadamanthys, Vidar, and RedLine. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/jackfix-uses-fake-windows-update-pop.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
          <li><strong>"Dark LLMs" Lower Cybercrime Barrier</strong>: Specialized, malicious Large Language Models (LLMs) like the commercial **WormGPT 4** (available for $220) and the free, open-source **KawaiiGPT** are significantly lowering the technical barrier to entry for cybercrime. WormGPT 4 can generate fully functional **AES-256 ransomware PowerShell scripts**, while KawaiiGPT creates convincing spear-phishing emails and scripts for lateral movement, automating critical steps in the attack process. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/25/wormgpt_4_evil_ai_lifetime_cost_220_dollars/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>OnSolve CodeRED Cyberattack Disrupts Emergency Alert Systems</strong>: Risk management company Crisis24 confirmed a cyberattack on its **OnSolve CodeRED platform**, critical for U.S. emergency notifications. The attack, claimed by the **INC Ransomware gang**, forced the platform's decommissioning and resulted in the theft of user data, including **names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and clear-text passwords**. The incident caused widespread disruption to emergency alert systems nationwide. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/onsolve-codered-cyberattack-disrupts-emergency-alert-systems-nationwide/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
          <li><strong>Code Formatting Sites Expose Massive Volume of Secrets</strong>: Researchers uncovered a severe data exposure risk on popular web-based code formatting sites, **JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify**. The sites' predictable public link URLs and a "Recent Links" feature allowed scraping over 80,000 JSON entries, exposing a massive volume of sensitive secrets, including **Active Directory credentials, cloud keys, GitHub tokens, and API keys**, belonging to organizations in critical sectors. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/11/25/code-formatting-sites-exposing-secrets/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
          <li><strong>Everest Ransomware Claims Major Breach of Iberia Airline and Air Miles España</strong>: The **Everest ransomware group** claims double-extortion breaches against Spanish airline **Iberia** and loyalty program operator **Air Miles España, S.A.** Everest claims to have stolen a 596 GB database from Iberia and 131 GB from Air Miles España, impacting millions of customers with exfiltrated data including **full identity information, travel histories, booking structures, and payment records**. <a href="https://hackread.com/everest-ransomware-spai-airline-iberia-breach/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

     <h2>📚 Others</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Tor Project Adopts CGO Encryption Algorithm</strong>: The Tor Project is replacing its outdated **tor1 relay encryption algorithm** with **Counter Galois Onion (CGO)** to bolster the network against modern traffic-interception and tagging attacks, enhancing user anonymity. CGO uses wide-block encryption, tag chaining to block tagging, and updates encryption keys after every cell for immediate forward secrecy, addressing key weaknesses in the old algorithm. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tor-switches-to-new-counter-galois-onion-relay-encryption-algorithm/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
