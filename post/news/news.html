  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>10,000+ Fortinet firewalls exposed to 2FA bypass</strong>: Over 10,000 devices remain vulnerable to CVE-2020-12812, a critical flaw in FortiOS SSL VPN. Attackers can bypass FortiToken prompts in LDAP environments by changing username case-sensitivity. CISA added this to the KEV catalog in 2021, but unpatched units still face automated global attacks. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-10-000-fortinet-firewalls-exposed-to-ongoing-2fa-bypass-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resecurity "breach" claimed to be honeypot</strong>: The group "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters" (SLH) claims to have breached Resecurity, but the firm states the attackers hit a sophisticated honeypot filled with synthetic data. Resecurity reportedly gathered telemetry and real IP addresses from the attackers during the process. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-claim-resecurity-hack-firm-says-it-was-a-honeypot/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Kimwolf botnet ensnares 2M Android devices</strong>: Targeting unbranded Android TV boxes and digital frames, Kimwolf exploits devices shipped with ADB enabled by default. It uses residential proxies like IPIDEA to bypass firewalls and spread across local networks, facilitating massive DDoS and ad fraud. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Transparent Tribe and Patchwork target South Asia</strong>: APT36 (Transparent Tribe) and Patchwork have intensified espionage against India and Pakistan using DeskRAT and StreamSpy. The campaigns use weaponized LNK files and WebSockets to evade detection, coinciding with a surge in MongoBleed (CVE-2025-14847) exploits. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/transparent-tribe-launches-new-rat.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Phishing via Google Cloud Application Integration</strong>: Attackers are abusing Google’s "Send Email" task to send malicious notifications from a legitimate Google address, bypassing DMARC and SPF. Over 3,200 organizations were targeted with multi-stage redirects to credential-harvesting sites. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/186425/cyber-crime/phishing-campaign-abuses-google-cloud-application-to-impersonate-legitimate-google-emails.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
