  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CISA warns of SmarterMail RCE (CVE-2026-24423)</strong>: CISA added a critical RCE flaw in SmarterTools SmarterMail to its KEV catalog following active exploitation in ransomware campaigns. The vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) stems from missing authentication in the ConnectToHub API, allowing attackers to point instances to malicious servers to execute OS commands. Patched in Build 9511 alongside an admin password bypass, federal agencies must update by Feb 26, 2026. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-smartermail-rce-flaw-used-in-ransomware-attacks/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DKnife toolkit targets edge devices</strong>: Cisco Talos uncovered DKnife, a China-nexus AitM framework active since 2019. Using seven Linux implants, it performs deep packet inspection on routers to hijack app updates and deliver ShadowPad/DarkNimbus backdoors. It specifically targets Chinese-speaking users, disrupts security traffic with TCP RST packets, and shares infrastructure with WizardNet campaigns. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/187716/malware/dknife-toolkit-abuses-routers-to-spy-and-deliver-malware-since-2019.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Global "Shadow Campaigns" by TGR-STA-1030</strong>: Unit 42 detailed a massive espionage operation (aka UNC6619) that compromised 70 organizations across 37 countries. Using the "Diaoyu" loader and a custom eBPF rootkit called "ShadowGuard," the group hides kernel-level processes to maintain long-term access. The actor focuses on government ministries and regions experiencing significant geopolitical shifts. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-actor-targets-155-countries-in-shadow-campaigns-espionage-op/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Signal phishing targeting high-ranking officials</strong>: German agencies (BfV and BSI) issued a joint advisory regarding state-sponsored phishing on Signal. Attackers impersonate "Signal Support" to trick political and military figures into sharing SMS verification codes or scanning malicious QR codes to hijack accounts. While no malware is used, the campaign risks compromising sensitive professional networks. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/german-agencies-warn-of-signal-phishing.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Pay phish uses "Live" support calls</strong>: Malwarebytes identified a sophisticated campaign using fake fraud alerts to initiate social engineering calls. Scammers posing as "Apple Billing & Fraud Prevention" establish trust before requesting real-time 2FA codes to seize Apple IDs. The attack is highly effective as it weaponizes legitimate security features against users during high-pressure scenarios. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/02/apple-pay-phish-uses-fake-support-calls-to-steal-payment-details" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BridgePay ransomware causes nationwide outage</strong>: U.S. payment provider BridgePay confirmed a ransomware attack that knocked its core processing systems offline. The outage forced many merchants and municipal entities to revert to cash-only transactions. While forensics suggest no payment card data was stolen, the recovery of APIs and virtual terminals is expected to be a prolonged process. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/payments-platform-bridgepay-confirms-ransomware-attack-behind-outage/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Flickr data exposure via third-party email provider</strong>: Flickr notified users of a security incident involving an external partner that exposed metadata for a portion of its 35 million users. Leaked data includes real names, IP addresses, and geographic locations, though passwords and payment info remained secure. The platform disabled the vulnerable system and warned users of potential follow-on phishing. <a href="https://hackread.com/flickr-data-breach-external-partner-security-flaw/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Tools & Tech</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tirith: New defense against terminal injection</strong>: A new open-source tool, Tirith, blocks homoglyph and terminal injection attacks by intercepting shell commands in real-time. It inspects pasted URLs for Unicode lookalikes and ANSI escapes that bypass human detection, providing a sub-millisecond security layer for developers using shells like zsh, bash, and PowerShell. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-tool-blocks-imposter-attacks-disguised-as-safe-commands/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EFF launches "Encrypt It Already" campaign</strong>: The EFF is holding tech giants accountable for unfulfilled encryption promises. The 2026 initiative targets Meta, Apple, Google, and Bluesky, demanding E2EE by default and protections against AI assistants scanning secure communications. The campaign frames encryption as a vital defense against both automated and state surveillance. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/encrypt-it-already-pushes-big-tech-e2e-encryption" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
