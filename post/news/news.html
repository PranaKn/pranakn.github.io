  <h2>📅 15/01/26</h2>

  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fortinet FortiSIEM RCE (CVE-2025-25256)</strong>: Fortinet addressed a critical RCE vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 affecting the phMonitor service (port 7900). Improper sanitization of CLI requests allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands. Horizon3.ai researchers noted similarities to previous flaws targeted by groups like Black Basta. Organizations are urged to update or restrict port 7900 access, as legacy versions remain vulnerable. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploit-code-public-for-critical-fortisiem-command-injection-flaw/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>"ConsentFix" OAuth Hijacking</strong>: Push Security identified a novel technique linked to APT29 that blends social engineering with OAuth phishing to bypass MFA and passkeys. Victims are tricked into pasting authorization codes into malicious pages, allowing attackers to hijack sessions for pre-consented first-party apps like Azure CLI. This bypasses standard Conditional Access policies. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/consentfix-debrief-insights-from-the-new-oauth-phishing-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Microsoft Copilot "Reprompt" Exploit</strong>: Varonis researchers discovered a critical exploit in Copilot Personal allowing invisible data exfiltration via a single malicious link. Using Parameter-to-Prompt injection and a "double-request" technique, attackers can harvest conversation histories and personal data. Microsoft patched the flaw in the January 2026 update; enterprise versions were not affected. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/reprompt-attack-let-hackers-hijack-microsoft-copilot-sessions/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DeadLock Ransomware "EtherHiding"</strong>: The group is abusing Polygon smart contracts to rotate proxy server addresses. This resilient C2 strategy uses a malicious HTML wrapper to query the blockchain for dynamic IPs, facilitating encrypted communications via the Session platform. DeadLock also utilizes "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) tactics for persistence. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/deadlock_ransomware_smart_contracts/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>VoidLink Linux Malware Framework</strong>: Check Point Research identified this advanced framework written in Zig, targeting cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba). Likely Chinese-affiliated, it features 30+ plugins for container abuse and credential theft. It uses kernel-level rootkits and anti-forensics modules to wipe its presence if analysis is detected. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/voidlink_linux_malware/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Predator Spyware Anti-Analysis Features</strong>: Jamf Threat Labs identified new capabilities in Intellexa’s spyware, including a diagnostic system that alerts operators (e.g., "error code 304") if security tools like Frida are detected. It also monitors network activity via netstat and suppresses crash logs to stay stealthy, turning failed deployments into intelligence. <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/predator-spyware-demonstrates-troubleshooting-researcher-dodging-capabilities/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Void Blizzard (UAC-0190) Targets Ukraine</strong>: Russian threat actors used Signal and WhatsApp to deliver the PLUGGYAPE backdoor via password-protected archives. The malware uses WebSockets and MQTT for communication, retrieving C2 info from paste services. Other clusters used VHD files and phishing to deploy the FILEMESS stealer and GAMYBEAR backdoor. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/pluggyape-malware-uses-signal-and.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fake PayPal Alerts Deploying RMMs</strong>: A new phishing campaign documented by CyberProof leverages fake payment alerts to trick victims into installing legitimate RMM tools like LogMeIn Rescue and AnyDesk. These "backdoors" often bypass EDR alerts and provide long-term access that can be sold to ransomware or APT actors. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hackers-fake-paypal-notices-deploy/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Kyowon Group Ransomware Attack</strong>: The South Korean conglomerate confirmed an attack affecting 600 of its 800 servers, disrupting education and hospitality sectors. While data exfiltration is confirmed, investigators are verifying if 5.5 million customer records were leaked. System restoration is nearing completion; no group has claimed credit yet. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/south-korean-giant-kyowon-confirms-data-theft-in-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windows WinSqlite3.dll False Positives</strong>: Microsoft resolved an issue where security software incorrectly flagged a core Windows component as vulnerable to CVE-2025-6965. The high-severity memory corruption flaw was discovered via Google’s Big Sleep AI. Updates released Jan 13, 2026, rectified the detection errors. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-updates-windows-dll-that-triggered-security-alerts/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>AISURU/Kimwolf Botnet Disrupted</strong>: Black Lotus Labs null-routed traffic to over 550 C2 nodes of a botnet that infected 2 million Android TV devices. By deploying the ByteConnect SDK, attackers turned these devices into residential proxy nodes for DDoS attacks and traffic relaying. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/kimwolf-botnet-infected-over-2-million.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Google Gemini 3 "Personal Intelligence"</strong>: Google launched a beta feature allowing Gemini to reason across Gmail, Photos, YouTube, and Search. The opt-in feature uses user data context to provide proactive insights while maintaining privacy controls to prevent direct training on sensitive personal files. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-gemini-personal-intelligence/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
