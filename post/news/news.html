     <ul>
          <li><strong>Bloody Wolf expands Java-based RAT campaign</strong>: The threat actor **Bloody Wolf**, active since late 2023, has expanded its spear-phishing campaign across Central Asia, targeting finance, government, and IT sectors in **Kyrgyzstan** since June 2025 and **Uzbekistan** as of October 2025. The group impersonates government ministries to deliver **NetSupport RAT**, leveraging social engineering. The attack chain uses a malicious **Java Archive (JAR) loader** to fetch the payload, establishing persistence via a scheduled task, Registry key, and a Startup batch script. The Uzbekistan campaign notably used **geofencing** to target local users only. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/bloody-wolf-expands-java-based.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
    
          <li><strong>Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters target Zendesk users</strong>: The cybercrime alliance **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters** is suspected of launching a new extortion campaign targeting **Zendesk users**, leveraging more than 40 typosquatted domains. The domains host fake single sign-on pages for credential harvesting or are used to submit malicious helpdesk tickets. Researchers warn that these weaponized tickets could lead to dropping **Remote Access Trojans** onto helpdesk agents' machines, enabling lateral movement and data theft. This strategy follows their pattern of abusing SaaS platforms. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/27/scattered_lapsus_hunters_zendesk/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
