  <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Critical Flaws in Versa, Zimbra, Vite, and ESLint</strong>: Several critical vulnerabilities have been disclosed across diverse enterprise and development platforms. Versa Concerto (CVE-2025-34026) suffers from improper authentication in its Traefik reverse proxy, exposing administrative endpoints. Synacor Zimbra (CVE-2025-68645) is vulnerable to PHP remote file inclusion. Vite (CVE-2025-31125) allows unauthorized file access when the dev server is exposed. Furthermore, the <code>eslint-config-prettier</code> package (CVE-2025-54313) was found to contain malicious code executing the node-gyp.dll malware on Windows during installation. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>SmarterMail Auth Bypass (CVE-2026-23760)</strong>: Threat actors are actively exploiting a critical authentication bypass in SmarterTools SmarterMail to hijack administrator accounts. The flaw resides in the <code>force-reset-password</code> API endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to reset the system admin password via a crafted JSON request. Attackers have gained SYSTEM-level access and executed remote commands. Organizations must upgrade to Build 9511 immediately. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smartermail-auth-bypass-flaw-now-exploited-to-hijack-admin-accounts/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>GNU InetUtils Telnetd Root Access (CVE-2026-24061)</strong>: A CVSS 9.8 vulnerability has been identified in the telnet daemon (telnetd), existing since 2015. Attackers can gain root access by supplying a crafted <code>USER</code> environment variable (<code>-f root</code>), which skips authentication. GreyNoise reports active global exploitation. Administrators should disable telnetd or restrict network access. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/critical-gnu-inetutils-telnetd-flaw.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Appsmith Account Takeover (CVE-2026-22794)</strong>: Researchers identified a "password reset poisoning" flaw in the Appsmith low-code platform. The app trusts the client-provided Origin HTTP header to build reset URLs, allowing attackers to leak unique reset tokens to their own servers. This enables full account compromise and exposure of internal databases. Users should upgrade to version 1.93. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/appsmith-flaw-account-takeovers/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 Zero-Days</strong>: On the second day of the competition in Tokyo, researchers earned $439,250 by exploiting 29 unique zero-day vulnerabilities in EV chargers, infotainment systems, and Tesla systems. The total prize pool has reached nearly $1M. Vendors have a 90-day window to patch before public disclosure. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-29-zero-day-vulnerabilities-on-second-day-of-pwn2own-automotive/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FortiGate SSO Exploitation</strong>: Arctic Wolf identified an automated campaign targeting Fortinet FortiGate devices via a suspected patch bypass (CVE-2025-59718). Attackers used the FortiCloud SSO feature to create rogue VPN accounts and steal firewall configs. Administrators are urged to disable FortiCloud SSO logins while awaiting FortiOS 7.4.11. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-fortinet-fortigate-devices-steal-firewall-configs/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Osiris Ransomware Targets SE Asia</strong>: A novel strain called Osiris, distinct from the old Locky variant, targeted a SE Asian food operator using a hybrid ECC/AES encryption. The attack used a BYOVD maneuver with the POORTRY driver to disable security tools. Links to the INC ransomware group have been suggested based on Mimikatz builds and Rclone usage. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/new-osiris-ransomware-emerges-as-new.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>LLM-Augmented Phishing</strong>: Unit 42 detailed "LLM-Augmented Runtime Assembly" attacks that use generative AI to dynamically build phishing pages. By calling APIs like Gemini or DeepSeek at runtime, attackers generate unique, polymorphic malicious JavaScript that evades traditional network security analysis because the code is created in real-time. <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/real-time-malicious-javascript-through-llms/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>Malicious PyPI Package 'sympy-dev'</strong>: A fake package impersonating the SymPy library was found on PyPI. It acts as a downloader for an XMRig cryptocurrency miner, executing in memory using <code>memfd_create</code> to avoid disk footprints. While currently used for mining, the implant is a general-purpose loader. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/malicious-pypi-package-impersonates/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Impersonation-as-a-Service Vishing</strong>: Okta reported a surge in sophisticated voice-phishing kits targeting Google, Microsoft, and Okta accounts. These kits sync fraudulent browser pages with verbal instructions from a live caller to bypass MFA. Phishing-resistant authenticators like FIDO2 are recommended for defense. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/crims_sell_voice_phishing_kits/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>LinkedIn DLL Side-Loading Campaigns</strong>: ReliaQuest uncovered attacks targeting executives where professional trust is established before sending a malicious WinRAR archive. The chain uses DLL side-loading and a portable Python interpreter to deploy a RAT, granting persistent access and data exfiltration capabilities. <a href="https://hackread.com/hackers-linkedin-dms-pdf-tools-trojan/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>LastPass Phishing Campaign</strong>: An active campaign uses "Scheduled Maintenance" emails to pressure users into creating vault backups on a credential-harvesting site. LastPass clarified they never request master passwords via email and urged users to report suspicious messages. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/01/fake-lastpass-maintenance-emails-target-users" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>AiTM Attacks in Energy Sector</strong>: Adversary-in-the-Middle campaigns are targeting the energy sector by stealing session cookies to bypass MFA. Attackers automate inbox rules to hide their presence. Microsoft emphasizes that password resets are insufficient; active sessions must be revoked. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/01/22/energy-sector-aitm-phishing-sharepoint-misuse/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💥 Breaches & Leaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INC Ransomware OPSEC Fail</strong>: Cyber Centaurs recovered exfiltrated data for 12 U.S. organizations after the INC ransomware group left S3 credentials in PowerShell scripts. Investigators retrieved stolen data from healthcare and manufacturing sectors by enumerating the attacker's repositories. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/inc-ransomware-opsec-fail-allowed-data-recovery-for-12-us-orgs/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>EmEditor Supply Chain Compromise</strong>: Attackers tampered with official EmEditor MSI installers to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands. The malware performs system fingerprinting and steals credentials. Geofencing logic suggests the threat actors avoid targeting Russia/CIS regions. <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/26/a/watering-hole-attack-targets-emeditor-users.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Others</h2>
