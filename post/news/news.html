     <h2>🛡️ Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>WhatsApp enumeration exposed 3.5B profiles</strong>: Researchers exploited weak rate limiting to probe over 100M numbers per hour across 245 countries, identifying 3.5B active WhatsApp accounts. Collected data included timestamps, profile photos, “about” texts, and E2EE public keys, revealing key reuse and even all-zero private keys. About half the numbers from Facebook’s 2021 breach remained active. Meta patched the issue in Sept–Oct 2025, emphasizing no message content was leaked. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/184886/mobile-2/researchers-devised-a-new-enumeration-technique-that-exposed-3-5b-whatsapp-profiles.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>SonicWall SonicOS SSLVPN DoS (CVE-2025-40601)</strong>: New stack-based buffer overflow in SonicOS SSLVPN for Gen7/Gen8 appliances lets remote unauthenticated attackers crash devices, causing denial-of-service. No exploitation or public PoC yet, but SonicWall urges upgrades to 7.3.1-7013+ (Gen7) and 8.0.3-8011+ (Gen8). Gen6 and SMA 100/1000 are not affected. As a workaround, admins should disable SSLVPN or restrict it to trusted sources. SonicWall also patched two Email Security flaws enabling persistent code execution and data exposure. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-sonicwall-sonicos-flaw-allows-hackers-to-crash-firewalls/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>D-Link DIR-878 EoL routers hit by RCE bugs</strong>: Three RCE flaws (CVE-2025-60672/60673/60676) in DIR-878’s DDNS, DMZ, and QoS settings plus a USB stack overflow (CVE-2025-60674) allow arbitrary command execution on all hardware revisions. Public PoCs are available, and the EoL status (since 2021) means no patches will be released. D-Link urges users to replace the router. Botnets like RondoDox and Aisuru are expected to weaponize these flaws for DDoS and mass hijacking. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/d-link-warns-of-new-rce-flaws-in-end-of-life-dir-878-routers/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>SolarWinds Serv-U critical RCE chain</strong>: SolarWinds fixed three critical bugs in Serv-U 15.5.2.2.102 that allow authenticated admins to achieve arbitrary code execution: path restriction bypass (CVE-2025-40549), broken access control (CVE-2025-40548), and a logic error (CVE-2025-40547). All are patched in Serv-U 15.5.3, with lower impact on Windows due to reduced default privileges. Additional medium-severity XSS and open-redirect flaws were patched in Observability Self-Hosted. Seven SolarWinds issues currently appear in CISA’s KEV, highlighting ongoing targeting. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/solarwinds-patches-three-critical-serv-u-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
     </ul>

     <h2>🎯 Adversaries</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Bloody Wolf expands Java-based RAT campaign</strong>: The threat actor **Bloody Wolf**, active since late 2023, has expanded its spear-phishing campaign across Central Asia, targeting finance, government, and IT sectors in **Kyrgyzstan** since June 2025 and **Uzbekistan** as of October 2025. The group impersonates government ministries to deliver **NetSupport RAT**, leveraging social engineering and accessible tooling. The attack chain uses a malicious **Java Archive (JAR) loader** to fetch an older version of the RAT, establishing persistence through a scheduled task, Registry key, and a Startup batch script. The Uzbekistan campaign notably used **geofencing** to target local users only. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/bloody-wolf-expands-java-based.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
    
    <li><strong>Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters target Zendesk users</strong>: The cybercrime alliance **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters** is suspected of launching a new extortion campaign targeting **Zendesk users**, leveraging more than 40 typosquatted domains. The domains host fake single sign-on pages for credential harvesting or are used to submit malicious helpdesk tickets. These weaponized tickets could lead to dropping **Remote Access Trojans** onto helpdesk agents' machines, enabling lateral movement and data theft. This strategy follows their pattern of abusing SaaS platforms and identity trust. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/27/scattered_lapsus_hunters_zendesk/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
    
          <li><strong>PlushDaemon EdgeStepper update hijacking</strong>: ESET detailed PlushDaemon, a China-aligned group hijacking software updates by compromising MIPS-based edge routers. Its EdgeStepper implant intercepts DNS for popular Chinese apps (Sogou Pinyin, Baidu Netdisk, QQ, WPS Office) and redirects update traffic to attacker servers delivering the SlowStepper modular backdoor. Active since 2018, SlowStepper enables credential theft, file exfiltration, WeChat data theft, and screenshots, while PlushDaemon stays low-profile via router-level persistence. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/chinese-apt-routers-hijack-software-updates" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Sturnus Android banking trojan</strong>: New trojan Sturnus targets victims in Southern and Central Europe with full device takeover. It abuses Accessibility logging to read decrypted content from WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, bypassing E2EE. The malware uses HTML overlays to steal banking credentials, performs keylogging, streams the screen, and provides remote control via VNC. It abuses Device Administrator rights for persistence and monitors system changes to evade detection, with researchers warning of impending larger campaigns. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/184878/cyber-crime/sturnus-new-android-banking-trojan-targets-whatsapp-telegram-and-signal.html" target="_blank">More info</a> | <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/new-sturnus-banking-trojan-targets-whatsapp-telegram-signal-messages/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Everest ransomware claims Petrobras data theft</strong>: Everest listed Brazil’s Petrobras on its leak site, claiming theft of 180+ GB of seismic survey data. One listing references 176 GB of navigation files from partner SAExploration, with 90+ GB tied to Petrobras; another covers Campos Basin 3D/4D surveys. The datasets allegedly include ship positioning, equipment layouts, hydrophone readings, and depth/pressure metrics that could erode Petrobras’ competitive edge. Everest demands contact via qTox within four days, following recent Under Armour breach claims. <a href="https://hackread.com/everest-ransomware-brazil-petrobras-breach/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Matrix Push weaponizes browser notifications</strong>: New PhaaS kit Matrix Push lets attackers abuse legitimate browser Push API notifications for phishing and malware delivery. Sold for $150/month, it provides a polished C2 dashboard to craft fake alerts impersonating PayPal, MetaMask, Cloudflare, Netflix, TikTok, and more. Once victims grant notification permission, phishing messages appear as native browser prompts, evading many defenses. Operators can track victims’ IP, OS, browser, crypto usage, and activity in real time, raising hard-to-mitigate social-engineering risk. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/matrix-push-c2-tool-hijacks-browser-notifications-phishing" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>ShadowRay 2.0 hijacks Ray AI clusters</strong>: Ongoing ShadowRay 2.0 attacks exploit CVE-2023-48022, a missing-auth flaw in Ray’s Job Submission API, to seize GPU-powered clusters. Despite a 9.8 CVSS score, more than 230,500 Ray servers are exposed online. Attackers submit jobs that turn Ray into a worm, spreading across dashboards and deploying XMRig miners, region-specific payloads, cron persistence, and process-hiding tricks while killing rival miners. Compromised clusters also launch Sockstress DDoS, making this a multi-purpose botnet. Anyscale released a port-exposure checker; strict firewalling and auth on port 8265 are critical. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/shadowray-20-exploits-unpatched-ray.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>UNC2891 ATM fraud ecosystem in Indonesia</strong>: Group-IB exposed UNC2891’s multi-year ATM fraud against two Indonesian banks, extending beyond the 2024 Raspberry Pi ATM hack. The group built a full ecosystem with money mule recruitment, cloned cards, and TeamViewer-guided ATM cash-outs in 2022–2024. Tooling included STEELCORGI packer, CAKETAP rootkit to bypass PIN and manipulate HSM ARQC checks, and backdoors like TINYSHELL, SLAPSTICK, and SUN4ME. Anti-forensics and long-term persistence across 30+ systems show ATM cybercrime is resurging. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/unc2891-money-mule-network-atm/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

    <li><strong>FBI and Amazon warn of holiday Account Takeover (ATO) surge</strong>: Amazon and the FBI have issued warnings about a major surge in **Account Takeover (ATO) fraud** targeting holiday shoppers, with losses exceeding $262 million reported to the FBI this year. Threat actors leverage **social engineering** (impersonating customer support) and **credential stuffing** to hijack accounts, sometimes bypassing MFA. Attack vectors include phishing texts, calls, look-alike websites, SEO poisoning, and the use of the **Matrix Push C2 platform** to abuse browser push notifications for phishing. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/holiday-shoppers-targeted-as-amazon-and-fbi-warn-of-surge-in-account-takeover-attacks" target="_blank">More info</a></li>
    
    <li><strong>CISA warns of commercial spyware attacks on Signal/WhatsApp users</strong>: CISA has issued an advisory warning that cybercriminals and state-backed groups are using **commercial spyware** to compromise the smartphones of "high-value" targets (political, military, government personnel). The attacks bypass end-to-end encryption by **compromising the device itself**. Techniques include tricking users into scanning malicious QR codes to link accounts or exploiting sophisticated **zero-click vulnerabilities**, such as the **LANDFALL exploit** (CVE-2025-21042) in a Samsung Android library triggered via a malformed WhatsApp image. <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/state-backed-spyware-attacks-are-targeting-signal-and-whatsapp-users-cisa-warns" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>APT24’s BadAudio supply-chain espionage</strong>: Google detailed a three-year campaign by China-linked APT24 using a new malware family, BadAudio. Delivered via spearphishing, watering holes, and widespread supply-chain compromise, BadAudio was injected into JavaScript on 20+ public sites and via a repeatedly breached Taiwanese marketing firm, tainting libraries used by 1,000+ domains. It uses DLL search-order hijacking and heavy obfuscation to gather system data and fetch AES-encrypted payloads like Cobalt Strike, remaining largely undetected despite years of use. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-badaudio-malware-used-in-apt24-espionage-campaigns/" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>Tsundere botnet uses Ethereum for C2</strong>: Tsundere, a fast-growing Windows botnet active since mid-2025, uses a lightweight JavaScript execution implant delivered via fake game installers and abused RMM tools. Loaders deploy Node.js with modules like <code>ws</code>, <code>ethers</code>, and <code>pm2</code>, persisting via registry keys. A September 2024 **Ethereum smart contract** publishes WebSocket C2 endpoints, enabling resilient rotation. The panel lets operators build MSI/PowerShell payloads, convert bots to proxies, and trade botnets. Overlaps with malicious npm campaigns and “123 Stealer” infra suggest Russian-speaking operators who avoid targeting Russia/CIS. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/tsundere-botnet-expands-using-game.html" target="_blank">More info</a></li>

          <li><strong>TamperedChef malvertising & fake installers</strong>: TamperedChef is a global malvertising operation distributing a JavaScript backdoor via fake, code-signed installers.
